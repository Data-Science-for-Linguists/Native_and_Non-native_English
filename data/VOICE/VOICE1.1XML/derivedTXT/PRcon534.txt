PRcon534:1	S1:	 wants to look at a hartogs domain there right we xx is equal to the i to the 
PRcon534:2	S2:	 what 
PRcon534:3	S1:	 right and then immediately have the defining function 
PRcon534:4	S2:	 @@@@ har- -togs domain is so bad 
PRcon534:5	S1:	 of course it was bad yeah but er 
PRcon534:6	S2:	 @@
PRcon534:7	S2:	 so you're been take those see any to the norm 
PRcon534:8	SX-2:	 @@@
PRcon534:9	S1:	 yeah
PRcon534:10	S2:	 oow
PRcon534:11	S1:	 it was more than a year ago i mean 
PRcon534:12	S2:	 so okay let's er 
PRcon534:13	S1:	 bu- but i play for so so the thing is how do you construct this swiss cheese thingy right
PRcon534:14	S2:	 in two dimension 
PRcon534:15	S1:	 oh in any dimension 
PRcon534:16	S2:	 well okay i can see how you can accept the 
PRcon534:17	S1:	 and then er which kind of er swiss cheese do you have to use such that the yah for empty fine interior but positive measure or however it works it's a long time ago that i haven't thought about it 
PRcon534:18	S2:	 oh but see that is true only in one dimension
PRcon534:19	S1:	 it is 
PRcon534:20	S2:	 that you know we have property b if if it has some empty fine interior that er that's only in c is it also doing in c n
PRcon534:21	S1:	 i don't know but you gotta we gotta play with things right
PRcon534:22	S2:	 yah that's true 
PRcon534:23	S1:	 i mean 
PRcon534:24	S2:	 so you think you should put a a cheese er cons- start with a cheese in c two and then put in a boundary of er three-dimensional 
PRcon534:25	S1:	 yes for example 
PRcon534:26	S1:	 mhm i mean the er i'm not saying i think this should work but i i think one should play with this
PRcon534:27	S2:	 why would that 
PRcon534:28	S2:	 yah i do 
PRcon534:29	S2:	 yah i'm just trying to say this
PRcon534:30	S1:	 yes
PRcon534:31	S2:	 if di- if d- if diagonal doesn't open in two dimension then what what part of this construction make it better even if it is a two di- dimension what kind of gain 
PRcon534:32	S1:	 tha- that you can construct p tilde easier than than than P see 
PRcon534:33	S2:	 i know i know but c 
PRcon534:34	S1:	 you can immediately 
PRcon534:35	S2:	 if this if this idea works in two dimension why then shouldn't it work in two er dimension
PRcon534:36	S1:	 if if 
PRcon534:37	S2:	 you know it what i'm saying
PRcon534:38	S1:	 well if if if commutator types all kinds of commutator types er work in two dimensions why don't you work in higher dimensions because you have too many directions going on
PRcon534:39	S2:	 we are using 
PRcon534:40	S2:	 so how doe- how the direction here the 
PRcon534:41	S1:	 does it er work in there
PRcon534:42	S2:	 because if you use the same idea to construct the same thing in high in different dimen- dimensions so what what it really the the d- difference is it because of our construction hh or is it because no matter how you construct it 
PRcon534:43	S1:	 but whose construction oh okay
PRcon534:44	S2:	 the xx said or no matter how we construct it actually from just higher dimension we gain something extra that 
PRcon534:45	S1:	 i don't know yet i stopped playing with it i've i've told you 
PRcon534:46	S2:	 i'm just asking it's to say or 
PRcon534:47	S1:	 yah okay right all right i i don't know but er is it's it's of course clear that er see that the idea of the swiss cheese had nothing the particular to do with c two we started with c two because c two is easy
PRcon534:48	S2:	 right 
PRcon534:49	S1:	 then we stopped with c two because w- ft- we realized that that er c two is not the way it appears to look at 
PRcon534:50	S2:	 aha 
PRcon534:51	S2:	 hh but so
PRcon534:52	S1:	 because there there there's already clear that there's no difference
PRcon534:53	S2:	 mhm er is it clear tha- that there's no difference in c two 
PRcon534:54	S1:	 i thought in c two p p tilde is the same 
PRcon534:55	S2:	 no no p and p tilde are not the same they are both apply the hull condition it's still not known actually if they are the same or not 
PRcon534:56	S1:	 in c two it's not known
PRcon534:57	S2:	 no it's not it's still not known
PRcon534:58	S1:	 so why are we moving up the whole dimensions then 
PRcon534:59	S2:	 well because 
PRcon534:60	S1:	 for what domain this is is it not known 
PRcon534:61	S2:	 the idea to put a swiss cheese there 
PRcon534:62	S1:	 that doesn't work
PRcon534:63	S2:	 is you won't have the hull condition
PRcon534:64	S1:	 oh and they both apply hull condition
PRcon534:65	S2:	 right 
PRcon534:66	S1:	 aha i thought in c two er haeh
PRcon534:67	S2:	 no no no it is only known in c two if you have a complete hartogs domain that is known but er in two dimension is s- still open 
PRcon534:68	S1:	 well then one why why going up in dimensions then it's okay well good 
PRcon534:69	S2:	 and it is even known that both of them are even stronger than the hull condition too
PRcon534:70	S1:	 okay mhm
PRcon534:71	S2:	 so it's possible to certain domain that has property wait what am i saying tha- that saisfies the hull condition but still not property p or p tilde 
PRcon534:72	S1:	 well maybe one should go back to c two then i'd 
PRcon534:73	S2:	 but then but then what is the argument that you see that they are different you will you will just need to construct that 
PRcon534:74	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah all done erm 
PRcon534:75	S2:	 and then to show that the other one cannot be constructed pos- cannot possibly be constructed if one of them is 
PRcon534:76	S1:	 are there unique centers for property p are not compend well if 
PRcon534:77	S2:	 if you knew that would be great too 
PRcon534:78	S1:	 maybe we should find any maybe we should start making a list of 
PRcon534:79	S2:	 no it's just 
PRcon534:80	S1:	 things one actually would 
PRcon534:81	S2:	 well i have a list of but they're all hard to er @
PRcon534:82	S1:	 yah 
PRcon534:83	S1:	 it's not even no 
PRcon534:84	S2:	 it's it's it's really hard to see a domain that does have a compactness with it i mean there is this example but that is in two dimension and hartogs domain but there is known all of them what i'm saying 
PRcon534:85	S1:	 yah yah yah yah yah
PRcon534:86	S2:	 so if there's that hartogs domain you don't know if it doesn't have a disk and boundary
PRcon534:87	S1:	 mhm mhm 
PRcon534:88	S2:	 it's still not known 
PRcon534:89	S1:	 what
PRcon534:90	S2:	 it's still not known 
PRcon534:91	S1:	 mhm so we have well at least two approaches right now locally local locality of p tilde right
PRcon534:92	S2:	 yah 
PRcon534:93	S1:	 wow one doesn't even understand non-p domains er i mean 
PRcon534:94	S2:	
PRcon534:95	S1:	 i mean the b regularity even does [last name1] didn't do anything in that directions
PRcon534:96	S2:	 ah well if he did it would be the same as p right
PRcon534:97	S1:	 yah but but haeh yah i know but hm
PRcon534:98	S2:	 so y- you didn't use an argument of partition of unity when you're er 
PRcon534:99	S1:	 yeah but on the conta- i use it but on the compactness level then
PRcon534:100	S2:	 oow
PRcon534:101	S1:	 i first moved to the l two estimates 
PRcon534:102	S2:	 i see 
PRcon534:103	S1:	 bec- i couldn't do it directly
PRcon534:104	S2:	 right 
PRcon534:105	S1:	 so i moved to the l two estimates
PRcon534:106	S2:	 and then we're there
PRcon534:107	S1:	 yeah
PRcon534:108	S2:	 this is so weird 
PRcon534:109	S1:	 there of course i yes and and in the that's why i had the same kind of proof twice it's it's is this duality argument of [last name2] i'll needed to do it twice because er 
PRcon534:110	S2:	 yeah 
PRcon534:111	S1:	 i couldn't do the partition of unity
PRcon534:112	S2:	 aha aha 
PRcon534:113	S1:	 so i once did it with the exact estimates @@@ and that's is always completely @ i @@@@ very weird @ they have proving things but they are 
PRcon534:114	S2:	 there's gotta be a way to see this more going i think 
PRcon534:115	S1:	 hm i'll get some more coffee hm
PRcon534:116	S2:	 hh hh i've there is one little point we don't see i don't know what it is but i feel there is one little tool if we could without a doubt then all this riddle will be solved 
PRcon534:117	S1:	 oh okay i'll i as i said i haven't thought about it for for a long 
PRcon534:118	S2:	 like in like in this er argument if you wanna show if i use partition of unity i did all of property P hh all you need to do is just really see that you can make it 
PRcon534:119	S1:	 that one of the the the that you can actually make them self-bounded 
PRcon534:120	S2:	 yes 
PRcon534:121	S1:	 xxx i'm surprised that nobody saw that before 
PRcon534:122	S2:	 well property p today itself is not a very old and that paper is like 
PRcon534:123	S1:	 no but when for instance [last name3] he was always 
PRcon534:124	S2:	 he didn't need 
PRcon534:125	S1:	 no but [last name3] was you for instance always destruct that he we needed uniform boundedness and he has gotten some similar estimates like [last name4] 
PRcon534:126	S2:	 mhm 
PRcon534:127	S1:	 where if he would have stared at it he w- would have seen if he assumes this breaking of the weight function to be bounded by the convex gesture
PRcon534:128	S2:	 mhm mhm 
PRcon534:129	S1:	 we could do things

PRcon534:135	S1:	 because of course those those self-bounded convex greatened functions you always can bound from one side right

PRcon534:161	S1:	 take general zero one and say at this unit one it you can zero and one x of n is it large xxx
