PRcon536:14	S7:	 er 
PRcon536:15	S7:	 strict pseudo-convexity 
PRcon536:16	S6:	 so you're talking about a plurisubharmonic er strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion

PRcon536:171	S6:	 aha aha okay i look it up i look it up 
PRcon536:172	S7:	 mathematic journalen so what year er it has to be between ninety-five and two thousand 
PRcon536:173	S6:	 okay i will look it up because i'm really interested 
PRcon536:174	S7:	 like this erm 
PRcon536:175	S6:	 hh you see people in real harmonic analysis they use this method of approximating a lipschitz domain with smooth domains and the fact that the normal vectors are approximated in l Q for all q k- less than infinity a lot so they have developed a huge 
PRcon536:176	S7:	 mhm 
PRcon536:177	S6:	 machinery that you know uses this approximation and i think that if you one wants to do
PRcon536:178	S7:	 but er 
PRcon536:179	S7:	 er you know it's it's something you have to impose
PRcon536:180	S6:	 yes 
PRcon536:181	S7:	 impose
PRcon536:182	S6:	 yah yah you have t- 
PRcon536:183	S7:	 so it's it's you have to impose and to work in such kind of domains
PRcon536:184	S6:	 yes yes 
PRcon536:185	S7:	 so in such kind of you have such kind of properties
PRcon536:186	S6:	 right hh b- 
PRcon536:187	S7:	 but when generally pseu- you cou- can of course strictly you mean 
PRcon536:188	S6:	 mhm 
PRcon536:189	S7:	 the more strictly 
PRcon536:190	S6:	 no no i'm only interested in strictly i'm only interested in strictly 
PRcon536:191	S7:	 yes in strictly yes in strictly it's er it's normal i think
PRcon536:192	S6:	 yeah
PRcon536:193	S6:	 aha hh that's that is very good you see the existence of a lipschi- er of a smooth approximation of a lipschitz domain is always granted hh so the the extra condition on the uniform lower bound is something that you request hh but it makes i mean it to me it makes sense because one shouldn't expect that every lipschitz domain should be strictly pseudo-convex so there must be something more right right 
PRcon536:194	S7:	 i know i'm sorry it's it's certainly not
PRcon536:195	S6:	 right right 
PRcon536:196	S7:	 certainly not strictly you have to give strictly 
PRcon536:197	S6:	 but i would be curious to know right but i would be curious to know whether this is equivalent to the epsilon absolute value c 
PRcon536:198	S7:	 yes 
PRcon536:199	S6:	 c square condition whether you know if if that condition holds 
PRcon536:200	S7:	 no 
PRcon536:201	S6:	 and the domain is lipschitz then 
PRcon536:202	S4:	 okay 
PRcon536:203	S6:	 so that's something that i would be interested in 
PRcon536:204	S7:	 yeah we're going
