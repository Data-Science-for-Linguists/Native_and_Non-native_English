EDwsd9:13	S5:	 try to give concrete examples on how it might be then how will life be how will 
EDwsd9:14	S1:	 yah and like er [S5] said just before the break er you can do this er or yeah you can do this in in a form of presentation so you can just er talk for ten minutes about er what you think it will be like or you can do a play or if you have powerpoint or anything er any form which you think is suitable is er is okay for us as long as if er as lon- if er as you can erm yah give us a a good and convincing erm scenario erm and
