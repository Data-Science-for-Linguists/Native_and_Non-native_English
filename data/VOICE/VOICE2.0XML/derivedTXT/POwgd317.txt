POwgd317:15	S4:	 okay there are three three sources of funding xx x er the external the national and the institutional
POwgd317:16	S2:	 yah 
POwgd317:17	S4:	 and this we have to point out before we get know each possibilities each partner have
POwgd317:18	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:19	S4:	 external result i think of a same for all ou- our european countries this is where er all erasmus erm er erasmus curriculum development er socrates curriculum development 
POwgd317:20	S2:	 no 
POwgd317:21	S2:	 yeah
POwgd317:22	S4:	 or i don't know what er making announcement or something on marie curie er i don't know about this
POwgd317:23	S1:	 it's usually research 
POwgd317:24	S2:	 marie curie yeah it's usually research and erm 
POwgd317:25	S1:	 but it's a it it's it's it but it's also e u still
POwgd317:26	S4:	 but it's not curriculum 
POwgd317:27	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:28	S4:	 mhm but maybe we don't go so precise but e u money is somewhere 
POwgd317:29	S2:	 er the erasmus mundus money it's e u money 
POwgd317:30	S4:	 then we have to go to the third countries er 
POwgd317:31	S2:	 and you 
POwgd317:32	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:33	S4:	 as well it's as question not criteria is that hhh are we european
POwgd317:34	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:35	S4:	 master master x but anyway er we're not er it's always european if you x symbol 
POwgd317:36	S2:	 but i mean if you're going to you i mean you can you can be in the european master level 
POwgd317:37	S5:	 move a little bit further if you want 
POwgd317:38	S2:	 but er you can admit er people from different countries either from europe or outside europe
POwgd317:39	S4:	 yes it's more money 
POwgd317:40	S4:	 yes
POwgd317:41	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:42	S4:	 but actually sometimes it is er er important er if you create this the joint master degree who is the target group if you 
POwgd317:43	S2:	 hm 
POwgd317:44	S4:	 think about the third third in countries maybe 
POwgd317:45	S2:	 of course 
POwgd317:46	S2:	 what did we said the last er last meeting we said about formulating er joint degrees at er at the special interest for european 
POwgd317:47	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:48	S2:	 as a european the target will be europeans
POwgd317:49	S4:	 yeah okay i expect 
POwgd317:50	S2:	 and er also w- we said at the last meeting as i remember correctly hh er that we have to take into consideration er what the demand is in europe as far as labor market is concerned and so as to target the you know the r- er 
POwgd317:51	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:52	S2:	 the right people erm so so we're going to have either tuition fees
POwgd317:53	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:54	S2:	 in order to finance a program
POwgd317:55	S4:	 but er actual we 
POwgd317:56	S4:	 we have to know whether it is possible to apply for tuition fees that's again a question of er er the different countries is it you know 
POwgd317:57	S1:	 in my country er erm 
POwgd317:58	S2:	 yeah in cyprus there is no problem i mean we can er charge erm tuition fees yeah 
POwgd317:59	S4:	 we also can 
POwgd317:60	S1:	 we we can only charge people from outside of europe
POwgd317:61	S2:	 ah okay 
POwgd317:62	S4:	 from outside europe 
POwgd317:63	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:64	S2:	 otherwise it's er there are no fees
POwgd317:65	S1:	 because danish students don't pay fees so we cannot charge europeans 
POwgd317:66	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:67	S4:	 from europeans 
POwgd317:68	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:69	S1:	 tu- tu- tui- 
POwgd317:70	S4:	 i think this is the question we have to ask from 
POwgd317:71	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:72	S5:	 yes
POwgd317:73	S4:	 from er countries there are they allowed to take er in er national 
POwgd317:74	S2:	 yes in cyprus it's different thing
POwgd317:75	S5:	 yes for example 
POwgd317:76	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:77	S5:	 did we start with f- with funding now is 
POwgd317:78	S2:	 funding yes 
POwgd317:79	S4:	 funding we thought that there is a pre- 
POwgd317:80	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:81	S1:	 ex- 
POwgd317:82	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:83	S4:	 three possibilities so where is er external funding where it's a national funding 
POwgd317:84	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:85	S4:	 and where is the institutional funding
POwgd317:86	S5:	 yeah
POwgd317:87	S4:	 and now we have to because external funding m- money there we can only suggest 
POwgd317:88	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:89	S4:	 where is the erasmus er where is the erasmus mundus or i don't know x where is more of er programs you can 
POwgd317:90	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:91	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:92	S4:	 nordplus but it's only you know under nordic countries
POwgd317:93	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:94	S4:	 where is a nor- xx neighbors and they can also ask money for joint degrees 
POwgd317:95	S1:	 but there can also be er like erm a th- a third partner not necessarily a northern 
POwgd317:96	S4:	 yes but this is also one of the criteria i don't know 
POwgd317:97	S5:	 is that mine
POwgd317:98	S1:	 yes 
POwgd317:99	S4:	 even we acc- accept partners outside the [org1] this is i think hh it's very difficult now to discuss because we haven't heard this er criteria it's just a unic- 
POwgd317:100	S5:	 yeah we have it we'll get it in a second hh although 
POwgd317:101	S4:	 mhm hh because if we are agreed but there is only partners er in [org1] 
POwgd317:102	S5:	 yeah i can answer you this question i- it should it should also erm i mean basically the criteria were also meant to to maintain some kind of flexibility that is erm partners in of er of other networks or non-[org1] partners 
POwgd317:103	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:104	S4:	 accepted 
POwgd317:105	S5:	 are also accepted in some cases but o- of course er the majority is 
POwgd317:106	S4:	 but maybe then this will be some country but hh at least two partners have to if for instance or or more 
POwgd317:107	S2:	 yeah f- for example there are three three partners the two of them should be [org1] 
POwgd317:108	S4:	 fifty percentage of partners i can know @
POwgd317:109	S5:	 yah i think that's something that will er that is defined in the criteria as well but generally as [first name1] also has just said hh i think that this is really a question that is that has to be answered by the individual institutions 
POwgd317:110	S1:	 yeah there're quite a lot of questions that needs to be answered by the individual 
POwgd317:111	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:112	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:113	S5:	 well then you know
POwgd317:114	S1:	 hm
POwgd317:115	S4:	 but let's put some some questions 
POwgd317:116	S5:	 then we have to do something like an analysis and we have to go some- through som- we're ki- kind of our result is that we have to go through a phase of of of of finding answers to these questions and maybe there might also be some hh some pa- some papers where where which where these cases are already 
POwgd317:117	S1:	 hh juridicy
POwgd317:118	S5:	 presented exactly 
POwgd317:119	S4:	 we made some con- sta- status quo y- there are some 
POwgd317:120	S1:	 is very good point for intervention 
POwgd317:121	S5:	 that that came out in er two thousand three or so or yeah
POwgd317:122	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:123	S1:	 yeah i think so 
POwgd317:124	S5:	 i think that cou- that very nicely sums up er s- at least some aspects so we of course have to see also have to do some research of what we of what kind of information we already got and 
POwgd317:125	S2:	 mhm yeah 
POwgd317:126	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:127	S5:	 hh you remember something like the sorry like the status er like the status quo that we have asked each er institution 
POwgd317:128	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:129	S5:	 to fill out maybe we can erm develop something like a grid er er like a er er a grid like the status quo grid that we can send out to the er hh 
POwgd317:130	S4:	 mhm questions 
POwgd317:131	S5:	 to all the bologna lab coordinators at the individual institutions and ask them to fill it out
POwgd317:132	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:133	SX-2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:134	S1:	 i think that'd be a very good idea 
POwgd317:135	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:136	S4:	 i think yes when we started our joint bachelor degree we started also in some where is a lot of questions er before the first meeting each partner had to 
POwgd317:137	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:138	S4:	 and then there's what kind of programs you offered what is the teaching method er h- er how many teachers you have xx xxx and all this kind of que- 
POwgd317:139	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:140	S4:	 er questions and er and then we found it's quite similar we are and 
POwgd317:141	S2:	 at least three [org1] universities
POwgd317:142	S4:	 yah but some questions are already answered 
POwgd317:143	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:144	S4:	 would not be ah excluded okay this is a question already it means er that er when er more different funding are available if we can for instance o- if er three er er northern countries from [org1] 
POwgd317:145	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:146	S4:	 would like to have an er a common joint degree when we just announced from this nor- nordplus name person that take a partner from russia or

POwgd317:154	S2:	 yeah

POwgd317:253	S5:	 in a questionnaire or something

POwgd317:257	S2:	 national and institutional
POwgd317:258	S5:	 and also as reg- 
POwgd317:259	S1:	 well insti- 
POwgd317:260	S1:	 isn't tuition fees a part 
POwgd317:261	S2:	 institutional i- tuiti- is it in h- is er in er the er tuition fees
POwgd317:262	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:263	S2:	 when we are saying about er institutional that er that er what w- we mean
POwgd317:264	S5:	 hh well i th- i not 
POwgd317:265	S2:	 for example now we are in er in the university of [place1] we hh er were in contact with a university in england so as to be our strategic partner for our m b a course
POwgd317:266	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:267	S2:	 and this course is going to be self-financed er i it's going to be financed
POwgd317:268	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:269	S2:	 er from the tuition fees
POwgd317:270	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:271	S2:	 so this is er institutional means 
POwgd317:272	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:273	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:274	S2:	 yes that's what we mean right
POwgd317:275	S5:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd317:276	S4:	 but i think it could be also for instance i- in the institutional level it is maybe much more easier just if you hh er 
POwgd317:277	S5:	 i think so 
POwgd317:278	S4:	 put in your next year budget for instance to create then some cooperation in erm joint degree by at an institutional level could be possible
POwgd317:279	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd317:280	S1:	 yeah i mean the way i said it could be tuition fees or it could be that the rectorate decides this is a high priority hh we we we allocate er erm a lump sum 
POwgd317:281	S2:	 yeah so we'll give this yeah this coun- 
POwgd317:282	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:283	S1:	 to 
POwgd317:284	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:285	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:286	S1:	 the university i mean but that's of course again 
POwgd317:287	S4:	 first two possibilities i think institution 
POwgd317:288	S1:	 a question within 
POwgd317:289	S2:	 yeah so this depends whether the university is a private one or a public one
POwgd317:290	S5:	 but er [org1] is only public 
POwgd317:291	S2:	 so in the i- i- 
POwgd317:292	S2:	 only public yeah so 
POwgd317:293	S1:	 i think erm all [org1] 
POwgd317:294	S5:	 [org1] 
POwgd317:295	S2:	 all [org1] 
POwgd317:296	S1:	 universities are 
POwgd317:297	S5:	 [org1] is only public 
POwgd317:298	S4:	 actually 
POwgd317:299	S2:	 so all the funding the the university funding the budget comes from the n- from national funds right so we're talking about the same thing 
POwgd317:300	S4:	 or from tuition fees 
POwgd317:301	S1:	 hh 
POwgd317:302	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:303	S2:	 or from tuition fees
POwgd317:304	S4:	 but erm you know in our case it's part from tuition fees and part from parliament 
POwgd317:305	S2:	 well in our case our budget is approved by th- by the the erm by the state
POwgd317:306	S1:	 mhm

POwgd317:335	S2:	 er or and national funding something like that 
POwgd317:336	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:337	S4:	 hm 
POwgd317:338	S2:	 and we have to ask whether they have 
POwgd317:339	S4:	 mhm funding 
POwgd317:340	S2:	 institutional funding there was going to be an institutional funding or and national funding
POwgd317:341	S1:	 okay but i just think that we should perhaps 
POwgd317:342	S4:	 to 
POwgd317:343	S1:	 specify what institutional funding could be that it'd also be tuition fees and or 
POwgd317:344	S2:	 one

POwgd317:353	S2:	 yah okay 
POwgd317:354	S5:	 i'll put these er questions er i'll type them i think that makes life easier for us all 
POwgd317:355	S2:	 yeah @@@ well it saves time as well 
POwgd317:356	S5:	 and saves time of our age 
POwgd317:357	S1:	 that's true 
POwgd317:358	S5:	 but the question is really whether this is something which is erm important for us to know in a questionnaire yes it is just x 
POwgd317:359	S2:	 it is important because yes it gives you an idea whether the university er will be ready or will be in our case i mean the departments w- wouldn't even discuss it wouldn't even discuss about joint degrees if they don't know anything about the funding
POwgd317:360	S5:	 of course 
POwgd317:361	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:362	S2:	 if they are going to be funding or not because they need extra resources and that's that i discussed this m- er issue with er hh the members of the committee of er hh postgraduate courses because we have a special committee
POwgd317:363	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:364	S2:	 of er postgraduate courses
POwgd317:365	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:366	S2:	 and er the first question was erm whether we find the money to do that 
POwgd317:367	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:368	S2:	 all that thing 
POwgd317:369	S1:	 it's always about the money 
POwgd317:370	S2:	 also 
POwgd317:371	S2:	 er yeah 
POwgd317:372	S1:	 @ but but even if we do this questionnaire 
POwgd317:373	S2:	 i mean 
POwgd317:374	S1:	 hh some and i and i don't shall su- suggest you but if we wanted sort of to to make a matrix as to 
POwgd317:375	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:376	S1:	 hear if a university or a department within the university is interested hh we have a matrix this could be some of the pillars on it saying if you put all the [org1] universities here we have the topics here 
POwgd317:377	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:378	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd317:379	S1:	 and we can just sort of check it 
POwgd317:380	S2:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd317:381	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:382	S1:	 tuition fees or not or funding and how 
POwgd317:383	S4:	 it's 
POwgd317:384	S4:	 it's exactly the same we have in our trained ba- bachelor program 
POwgd317:385	S2:	 it will be very easy just to have this table 
POwgd317:386	S5:	 so the 
POwgd317:387	S2:	 because er it's 
POwgd317:388	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:389	S2:	 you get a very good impression of er you know er what each university is doing and 
POwgd317:390	S5:	 so 
POwgd317:391	S5:	 uhu 
POwgd317:392	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:393	S5:	 so we should really right from the beginning not design it as something like a questionnaire but really as a matrix or as x the grids er that we'll 
POwgd317:394	S2:	 matrix a table yes 
POwgd317:395	S4:	 matrix yes mhm 
POwgd317:396	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:397	S1:	 w- yeah 
POwgd317:398	S5:	 yeah it i i think it's very helpful yeah
POwgd317:399	S4:	 cos now we are we have already this kind of checklist that has be done already 
POwgd317:400	S2:	 er maybe it should be done the same way as was the erm status quo report that we did in july 
POwgd317:401	S5:	 yeah i think so 
POwgd317:402	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:403	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:404	S1:	 mhm but that yeah 
POwgd317:405	S2:	 it was a sort of table 
POwgd317:406	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:407	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:408	S1:	 because there should also be room for notes er because sometimes you can't really explain everything with 
POwgd317:409	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:410	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:411	S1:	 with a check check mark 
POwgd317:412	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:413	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:414	S1:	 i don't know 
POwgd317:415	S4:	 cos i think it's certainly important that the institutional funding is rare because er you never get the always the money or for long term
POwgd317:416	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:417	S4:	 the money from e u or something so it must be hh the funding or 
POwgd317:418	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:419	S4:	 somehow this joint er master or joint degrees must be one of high priorities in university and international policy 
POwgd317:420	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:421	S4:	 cos er for instance you get the money to develop a course maybe you get the money to erm run er first year but then you have to prove that you're able to run it er 
POwgd317:422	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:423	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:424	S4:	 by your own finances 
POwgd317:425	S2:	 in our case we had two different views regarding this issue hh er the committee of student er of postgraduate studies they said we're not going to do anything we're gonna not going to discuss about joint degrees or abou- or about the promotion of joi- joint degrees unless the rectorate tells us how it's going to finance this things the international committee though hh er had a different opinion the international committee of the senate they said that they told me [S2] go ahead do this you know research and this er content with the departments hh to see whether there is an interest 
POwgd317:426	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:427	S2:	 er to formulate joint degrees hh in order then come back to us 
POwgd317:428	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:429	S2:	 tell us i mean let me let us have your feedback and then we will see er where where we can find the money from from the budget so there we- there are two different approaches 
POwgd317:430	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:431	S2:	 and we have to balance this two hh er different approaches that we have within the university er it's a it's different kind you know er 
POwgd317:432	S1:	 hh hm
POwgd317:433	S2:	 to go around it 
POwgd317:434	S4:	 mhm opinion there somehow where is er like a 
POwgd317:435	S2:	 @@@@
POwgd317:436	S4:	 benchmark long term 
POwgd317:437	S2:	 yeah the vice-rector i mean tha- he was telling now that we w- we will go ahead and 
POwgd317:438	S4:	 but that 
POwgd317:439	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:440	S2:	 do this with the departments and see what's going on and then we will find the funding
POwgd317:441	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:442	S4:	 yes it's also if it's er one of priorities i think they will do it because it's er 
POwgd317:443	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:444	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:445	S4:	 gives you so much benefits for u- for u- er university and for students 
POwgd317:446	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:447	S4:	 and actually i think this er creation of this er program or developing this program is is much more cost 
POwgd317:448	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:449	S4:	 cost er take much more cost as er later to run it because you can er for instance er 
POwgd317:450	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:451	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:452	S4:	 er have this er erasmus agreement mobility agreements between and you can support the students' mobility even teachers' teachers' mobility 
POwgd317:453	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:454	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:455	S4:	 and er i think there are different er scholarships maybe available for students to go and 
POwgd317:456	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd317:457	S4:	 but it depends of of course how many er how big number of students are going to 
POwgd317:458	S2:	 hm yeah 
POwgd317:459	S4:	 be mobile @
POwgd317:460	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:461	S5:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:462	S4:	 is it er the whole group or just part of a group i don't know it's again in criteria i think 
POwgd317:463	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:464	S4:	 ah xx xxxx xx xx xxx 
POwgd317:465	S5:	 erm is it part i mean just to come back to the er er as i'm a bit er you know i'm trying to stick to the time as well erm do we then formulate two questions what kind of national funding or do does your university 
POwgd317:466	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:467	S2:	 yeah yeah sure 
POwgd317:468	S5:	 have

POwgd317:534	S5:	 mhm

POwgd317:543	S2:	 it's the final thing to do after you have the er erm the approval of the fo- in our case what happened was that er our member of the academic staff the economics department discuss with are partners they formulated a proposal they submitted a proposal to the erm committee of er postgraduate courses er and then to the er there is another committee of er er student affairs
POwgd317:544	S5:	 mhm

POwgd317:546	S5:	 mhm

POwgd317:548	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:549	S2:	 er for approval and after it is approved by the rectorate council then the senate automatically appro- approves it when all this is approved 
POwgd317:550	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:551	S2:	 hh er then the rector will sign the agreement with the rector of the other universit- with the rectors of the other universities
POwgd317:552	S5:	 okay 
POwgd317:553	S5:	 so do we have 
POwgd317:554	S2:	 so i don't know whether it is the correct thing to do but er this is what we've done in this specific case
POwgd317:555	S4:	 okay 
POwgd317:556	S2:	 because there was o- you know the first time have a joint degree so 
POwgd317:557	S4:	 mhm but 
POwgd317:558	S5:	 hh well is isn't that also a question is isn't that also a question who who
POwgd317:559	S2:	 who approves 
POwgd317:560	S5:	 approves 
POwgd317:561	S4:	 but where is i think er this such should be somehow erm stressed on [org1] but it should be 
POwgd317:562	S2:	 of course 
POwgd317:563	S4:	 too by rectors at least otherwise whe- for instance one university tells it is only up to erm department head and if we don't tell that [org1] label erm to get a you know the [org1] label hh a whole university or at at least it should be 
POwgd317:564	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:565	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:566	S2:	 be- becau- 
POwgd317:567	S4:	 stressed 
POwgd317:568	S2:	 in in our case the erm the committee of er postgraduate studies hh er goes through the academic part of the agreement
POwgd317:569	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:570	S2:	 and the international relations committee goes through their administrative international part of the agreement
POwgd317:571	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:572	S4:	 mhm we don't have such permission in for instance we er if i i'll go back to my er what we have is joint bachelor degree erm 
POwgd317:573	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:574	S2:	 you don- you don't have 
POwgd317:575	S4:	 in process at the moment of course hh we are a network for several years so 
POwgd317:576	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:577	S4:	 so but er we ha- signed first this letter of intent but we are following with 
POwgd317:578	S5:	 yeah a letter of intent yah 
POwgd317:579	S2:	 yeah this is initial stage 
POwgd317:580	S4:	 this is should be the initi- 
POwgd317:581	S2:	 the initial thing stage 
POwgd317:582	S5:	 and the letter of inten- the letter of intent is er written by 
POwgd317:583	S2:	 letter of intent is between the two rectors again in our case any letters of intent or memorandum of understanding 
POwgd317:584	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:585	S2:	 they are signed by the by the rector
POwgd317:586	S4:	 by the rector
POwgd317:587	S2:	 or 
POwgd317:588	S2:	 yeah either by the two rectors or by the two heads of the department that are going to collaborate
POwgd317:589	S4:	 mhm in our case it sure it is enough when it is signed by er hh sometimes even by a head of a department but er i- actually would be a dean of the faculty 
POwgd317:590	S2:	 yeah or the head of the department the dean of the faculty or the rector
POwgd317:591	S4:	 at least 
POwgd317:592	S4:	 if erm 
POwgd317:593	S4:	 but not by rector rector signs in our case only the agreements 
POwgd317:594	S2:	 depending on the agreement 
POwgd317:595	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:596	S2:	 because we we have two kinds of agreements we have er departmental agreements so the two heads of the departments sign the agreement and we have the general agreements that the two rectors sign the agreement
POwgd317:597	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:598	S4:	 mhm then the whole university is involved in er that case our rector sign then hh it concerns the whole university if it's er more related 
POwgd317:599	S2:	 yes yes yes yes hh but yeah 
POwgd317:600	S2:	 but this is a general form of agreements now we're talking about joint degrees it is more specific
POwgd317:601	S5:	 yah i think er again 
POwgd317:602	S2:	 it has to do with the department i guess 
POwgd317:603	S4:	 but anyway it is erm many very much time-consuming and money-consuming and if rector doesn't er approve it or somehow er support it then it's really difficult to get later money when they just well if you do it in your faculty level let's do it and wh- what do we expect from us
POwgd317:604	S5:	 but again this is a question that er has to be ask huh
POwgd317:605	S4:	 when 
POwgd317:606	S2:	 we're talking about the contracts and agreements 
POwgd317:607	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:608	S2:	 and er er the main issue is er the timing of you know i mean when to do things the who is going to sign the agreements if there are going to be letter of intent is the- i- the- is this going to be in a letter of intent before signing the the agreement who is going to sign the letter of intent who is going to sign the agreement er when and where you submit a proposal if the- if you have a specific committee senate committee er how do you submit the proposal for er for approval
POwgd317:609	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:610	S1:	 so who sort of 
POwgd317:611	S5:	 @
POwgd317:612	S1:	 by law allowed to sign 
POwgd317:613	S2:	 @
POwgd317:614	S1:	 cos right now with the new danish law it's only the minister
POwgd317:615	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd317:616	S1:	 who can app- approve a joint program hh and he has stated very much that he will only approve such a program if the compensences or if the program is not already in place in denmark
POwgd317:617	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:618	S1:	 there you go 
POwgd317:619	S2:	 okay 
POwgd317:620	S1:	 very few @@
POwgd317:621	S5:	 mhm hh s- but again this is a this varies again so we also ha- we'd also have to find out 
POwgd317:622	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:623	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:624	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:625	S5:	 erm who has the ri- er right of appro- -proval 
POwgd317:626	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:627	S5:	 er and er i mean what we can basically say is that within [org1] we want er we have the agreement or the the contract as regards the the criteria hh and er what would what is generally recommended is something like a letter of er a er a letter of intent or a memorandum of understanding and then a letter of commitment
POwgd317:628	S2:	 yes this is a this is a
POwgd317:629	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:630	S4:	 mhm well x xx xxxx 
POwgd317:631	S5:	 that's a two step 
POwgd317:632	S1:	 and yeah yeah it is and 
POwgd317:633	S4:	 to be 
POwgd317:634	S2:	 and there we have the hole between xxx 
POwgd317:635	S4:	 here is er actually 
POwgd317:636	S5:	 between who very much depends on
POwgd317:637	S4:	 actually with [S7] here this paper er we have it done in this erm er master degree program something 
POwgd317:638	S5:	 on the structure huh
POwgd317:639	S4:	 principles concerning and there is a quite nicely listed what should be in er 
POwgd317:640	S1:	 yah 
POwgd317:641	S4:	 in er this agreement or or this topic should be divided between letter of intent and 
POwgd317:642	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:643	S4:	 erm the from rector we accept er ac- er a- accept more 
POwgd317:644	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:645	S4:	 finance support there er which should be running 
POwgd317:646	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:647	S2:	 because you need to have an institutional commitment
POwgd317:648	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:649	S2:	 if you don't have the si- the rector signing the agreement then but the this is a final stage in our case this is the final stage the
POwgd317:650	S5:	 i think in general 
POwgd317:651	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:652	S1:	 but i also think it's it's it's sort of a qualities assurance aspect in this that if it's only one department that i can i actually just 
POwgd317:653	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:654	S1:	 enter at any free will i mean er what how can you be sure of the obligations of the participating university if rector actually signs it hh it actually means that the entire university 
POwgd317:655	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:656	S1:	 backs 
POwgd317:657	S5:	 exactly so er the letter of of commitment by rectors should be there anyway
POwgd317:658	S1:	 this joint program 
POwgd317:659	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:660	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:661	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:662	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:663	S5:	 at the at the very end
POwgd317:664	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:665	S2:	 hh because as i explained before is that we have in the universities of [place1] we have a specific erm procedure erm i mean we had many things you know er we had a pro- a progress regarding joint degrees since our er meeting in july and as i as i explained to er before is that we er the department submits a proposal to the committee of er st- postgraduate studies er they go through the agreement they fix it they make comments they er and then we have the final thing hh and this final thing goes to the rectorate council
POwgd317:666	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:667	S2:	 it's approved by the rectorate council a- it's approv- er it's er you know it's very er bureaucratic to also to get approved by the senate because the rectorate council represent the senate
POwgd317:668	S1:	 mhm
POwgd317:669	S2:	 so after this is finalized then the whole agreement were er is signed by the rector
POwgd317:670	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:671	S5:	 er i just i have to leave you for something like ten minutes because i have to check my emails for xxxxx hh erm 
POwgd317:672	S2:	 okay yeah yeah 
POwgd317:673	S5:	 i i continue writing this up later on or do you wanna do it in between or 
POwgd317:674	S2:	 okay 
POwgd317:675	S2:	 okay do you want to write the questions or 
POwgd317:676	S5:	 i have i've written the question now as regards contracts and agreements i said it's two steps basically always er should be a letter of intent or something like a memorandum of understanding
POwgd317:677	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:678	S5:	 hh and secondly a letter of commitment by the rectors
POwgd317:679	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:680	S5:	 but the question that should go to the univ- universities is who has to right to approve 
POwgd317:681	S1:	 hm
POwgd317:682	S5:	 the contract or the xx 
POwgd317:683	S2:	 yeah who approves the contract 
POwgd317:684	S5:	 that that 
POwgd317:685	S2:	 and the contract xxxxx 
POwgd317:686	S5:	 that the the the basically the the individuals or the the groups who are allowed to 
POwgd317:687	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:688	S5:	 to do the contract hh and i think we could then i mean you know 
POwgd317:689	S2:	 hh and also no- not only who approves but who formulates 
POwgd317:690	S5:	 who app- to approve 
POwgd317:691	S2:	 i mean er content er what er i mean what are the the main elements er that er an agreement should have 
POwgd317:692	S5:	 mhm
POwgd317:693	S2:	 w- we have to look into it as well 
POwgd317:694	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:695	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:696	S4:	 some template or 
POwgd317:697	S2:	 the template
POwgd317:698	S1:	 hh yes 
POwgd317:699	S2:	 the provisions the key issues 
POwgd317:700	S1:	 but also 
POwgd317:701	S1:	 for instance admission er cri- criteria
POwgd317:702	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:703	S1:	 erm because if we have one program from three different universities the student do they get accepted to the program or do they have to be enroled at one particular university before they can do 
POwgd317:704	S2:	 yeah this is the main issue yeah 
POwgd317:705	S1:	 and perhaps that should be clarified in the contract as well
POwgd317:706	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:707	S4:	 the contract but i think in this letter of support or something from rector it should be erm that er we have good students we have enough staff which will be work in this process and we have er 
POwgd317:708	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:709	S4:	 fina- finances work 
POwgd317:710	S2:	 and who is going to be in charge who is going to be the coordinator
POwgd317:711	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:712	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:713	S2:	 of the agreement 
POwgd317:714	S4:	 this is also 
POwgd317:715	S2:	 who is going to take care of the change of students for example in our case is international office 
POwgd317:716	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:717	S2:	 so this is specified in the agreement who is going to be in charge of the you know the not only the recruitment but er the admissions and the change the actually change hh erm 
POwgd317:718	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:719	S4:	 and people who are responsible for that because not all people can be it's er or is it er faculty somebody in the faculty 
POwgd317:720	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:721	S2:	 the consortium should have a coordinator who is going to be the consortium's coordinator
POwgd317:722	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:723	S4:	 x 
POwgd317:724	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:725	S2:	 erm 
POwgd317:726	S4:	 but there i- er in that case in which stage it should be done for you er immediately if we have er this idea and we it's for instance three four partners er are ready to create consortium in which steps or stage this kind of paper should be made this letter of intent 
POwgd317:727	S1:	 a letter of 
POwgd317:728	S1:	 a letter of intent should probably be
POwgd317:729	S4:	 be first 
POwgd317:730	S1:	 yeah and and sort of in 
POwgd317:731	S4:	 this is just 
POwgd317:732	S2:	 very general 
POwgd317:733	S1:	 very general exactly and then 
POwgd317:734	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:735	S4:	 but we are ready to participate in this and er er yes and er the re- 
POwgd317:736	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:737	S1:	 the actual contracts should then have 
POwgd317:738	S2:	 very very very specific and very detailed
POwgd317:739	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:740	S4:	 and after that 
POwgd317:741	S1:	 i think so too 
POwgd317:742	S2:	 and then there are the legal issues that are involved 
POwgd317:743	S1:	 mhm
POwgd317:744	S2:	 regarding the recognition regarding 
POwgd317:745	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd317:746	S2:	 er the number of credits that they're going to be that the students will er will be accredited with
POwgd317:747	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:748	S2:	 there are many many issues to include in one agreement
POwgd317:749	S1:	 yeah actually most of most of er of the things listed there 
POwgd317:750	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:751	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:752	S2:	 because everything should be straightforward and clarified in the agreement 
POwgd317:753	S4:	 but er er in what 
POwgd317:754	S4:	 but in what 
POwgd317:755	S4:	 case if we put all these things in agreement i- hh it means that we have had even one or two er meetings er among their partners 
POwgd317:756	S1:	 yes 
POwgd317:757	S4:	 to decide this point 
POwgd317:758	S2:	 yeah the minimum the minimum 
POwgd317:759	S4:	 is it is li- er like in the end of er of before we start this process to 
POwgd317:760	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:761	S4:	 do something when should be the agreement so it's er i think at this one two meetings we decide the er common er er prerequisites or common things admission process er which er and everything 
POwgd317:762	S2:	 the members of the academic staff i mean they have the idea as [S6] said before they have the idea they have their er candidate partners they talk with them if they are er 
POwgd317:763	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:764	S2:	 if they have comm- gr- common grounds they go ahead and they discuss i mean you know about the content of the course what they want to 
POwgd317:765	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:766	S2:	 erm to achieve and all that stuff hh but then you ha- you er 
POwgd317:767	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:768	S2:	 when you talk about the details of the agreements then the administrative part the s- the administrator should be also involved
POwgd317:769	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:770	S4:	 yes 
POwgd317:771	S2:	 at the same time not not on their own but with with the members of the academics with their coordinators 
POwgd317:772	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:773	S2:	 in each institutions in eas- in each institution
POwgd317:774	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:775	S4:	 yes at least at the beginning before they go to the content 
POwgd317:776	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd317:777	S4:	 there should be also administrative part er be involved and 
POwgd317:778	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:779	S4:	 we did the same actually @@ in our program 
POwgd317:780	S2:	 because usually you get stuck i mean when you start fi- talking about the details is is this is where you get stuck @@
POwgd317:781	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:782	S2:	 and maybe there are disagreements or maybe there are different er systems of course there w- there are going to be different 
POwgd317:783	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:784	S2:	 different structures and systems and er procedures and this these are the kind of things that er have been to er they need to be sorted out and once they're agreed orally then then they have to be included in the agreement
POwgd317:785	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:786	S4:	 mhm
POwgd317:787	S1:	 so it's a comprehensive agreement at the very end erm just before you start actually advertising for students erm 
POwgd317:788	S2:	 of course 
POwgd317:789	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:790	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:791	S4:	 mhm er 
POwgd317:792	S1:	 agreement erm entailing hhh er well i suppose funding admission er procedure 
POwgd317:793	S2:	 because the students need to know all this information
POwgd317:794	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:795	S2:	 and they they have to be hh er clearl- clearly stated
POwgd317:796	S1:	 mhm
POwgd317:797	S2:	 the length of a program the e c t s that they are going to be accredited
POwgd317:798	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:799	S2:	 er if there is a period of er exchange to other partner universities er for how long they can be er they are goi- they have to go for a semester for two semesters
POwgd317:800	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:801	S2:	 er all these you know details when the program starts when it finishes what kind of exams they have to take er how many how many courses to take er how many theses how many assignments erm all the details of a program
POwgd317:802	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:803	S2:	 because this are these are basically what er every er students asks 
POwgd317:804	S1:	 true 
POwgd317:805	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:806	S2:	 er the method of examination of assessment examination 
POwgd317:807	S1:	 yeah quality assurance mechanisms 
POwgd317:808	S2:	 of course 
POwgd317:809	S4:	 and of course what what kind of degree we issue after 
POwgd317:810	S2:	 of cou- this is the most important thing 
POwgd317:811	S4:	 graduating @
POwgd317:812	S2:	 yes 
POwgd317:813	S4:	 we don't cos then 
POwgd317:814	S2:	 whether the degree is going to be recognized by the country or which countries it's going to be recognized from because i get this degree in order to be able to go out in the labor market and find a job if if the the degree is not going to be recognized tha- that's 
POwgd317:815	S4:	 but
POwgd317:816	S1:	 hm 
POwgd317:817	S2:	 then what's the use of er 
POwgd317:818	S4:	 but i- i- 
POwgd317:819	S2:	 of er you know attending it
POwgd317:820	S4:	 but er i have one question if we put all this things on the agreement who er 
POwgd317:821	S1:	 yes 
POwgd317:822	S4:	 is it er who sign this er beside it's only rector commitment er if agreement agreement it is between somebody is between the consortia and er rector or i- we are talking about the letter of commitment of if you if you talk about agreement agreement is between somebody has to sign the two partners 
POwgd317:823	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:824	S4:	 and when fro- from one side is the hh its rector who is a- -nother part
POwgd317:825	S2:	 mhm
POwgd317:826	S4:	 is the consortium if they don't have a head of consortia or a board of consortia who all all the universities will sign it er it's er then a little bit tricky 
POwgd317:827	S2:	 maybe you can have a general agreement it is what we did we'll do now i mean for example with this er the example i gave you regarding our ne- our m b a course er we have an a general agreement of cooperation
POwgd317:828	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:829	S2:	 with this er university that we are talking with and we are going to have a special addendum under this agreement that it's going to be more detailed 
POwgd317:830	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:831	S2:	 when er the two screws of management are going to finalize the sort of agreement that they want to have then we're going to have a separate agreement that it's going to be an addendum to the existing general agreement 
POwgd317:832	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:833	S2:	 with our partner university which and this agreement that addendum the new addendum will give all this information i was talking about 
POwgd317:834	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:835	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:836	S4:	 but anyway if you're talk- er you really have two partners you 
POwgd317:837	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:838	S4:	 and a norway university if we have for instance four 
POwgd317:839	S2:	 if we have four partners you have to do the same thing with all the partners 
POwgd317:840	S4:	 universities 
POwgd317:841	S4:	 from ea- by each 
POwgd317:842	S2:	 if ea- by each
POwgd317:843	S4:	 so 
POwgd317:844	S2:	 so hh for example if we have er for example 
POwgd317:845	S4:	 but actually it's it's not er in that case we got four bilateral agreements but it's not case we are going to do a joint degree so it means that we should have one 
POwgd317:846	S2:	 @
POwgd317:847	S4:	 one paper
POwgd317:848	S2:	 hh there is also the other case of er a joint program or a joint degree hh i mean er 
POwgd317:849	S4:	 for a 
POwgd317:850	S2:	 for example a student enrols in the university of [place1] it can go to [place3] for a semester o- er or a year as part of the course maybe if the course is is a two year program hh for example the student spends a year in [place3] 
POwgd317:851	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:852	S2:	 if it's not going to be a joint degree then it can be a double degree he gets two degrees from yeah [place1] univer- university of [place1] hh and from [place3] 
POwgd317:853	S4:	 yeah and from [place3] yes 
POwgd317:854	S2:	 or he can get a degree only from the university of [place1] or only from [place3] 
POwgd317:855	S4:	 mhm
POwgd317:856	S2:	 er these these things they have to be discussed 
POwgd317:857	S4:	 yes yes i understand 
POwgd317:858	S2:	 between the partners and er be clarified hh and the students should know in advance hh er where she or he will get the degree from
POwgd317:859	S4:	 what kind of 
POwgd317:860	S4:	 mhm
POwgd317:861	S1:	 oh yeah definitely
POwgd317:862	S2:	 yeah def- 
POwgd317:863	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:864	S2:	 and then a student from [place3] can come to the university of [place1] to do part of the course but he only gets a degree from [place3] 
POwgd317:865	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:866	S2:	 not from the university of [place1] and our student gets it's th- er his or her degree from university of [place1] 
POwgd317:867	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:868	S2:	 not from both [place3] and university of [place1] 
POwgd317:869	S4:	 okay 
POwgd317:870	S2:	 joint degrees are more are not so often are not so common er er er from what i hear it's easier to have a double degree
POwgd317:871	S4:	 also in er in our case it's also allowed to get double degree
POwgd317:872	S2:	 yes yeah yeah 
POwgd317:873	S4:	 in our x network we also discuss what kind of degree and we of course most of the countries are not allowed to issue a 
POwgd317:874	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:875	S4:	 joint degree we we are we are able to give a double degree so it means you er study your part-time in er at home and then you go to another 
POwgd317:876	S2:	 and only your rector signs right
POwgd317:877	S4:	 er yes 
POwgd317:878	S2:	 yes only your rector signs er 
POwgd317:879	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:880	S2:	 the degree
POwgd317:881	S4:	 yes yes and er she or he gets er another diplom 
POwgd317:882	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:883	S2:	 mhm

POwgd317:892	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd317:893	S2:	 hh and er the first er step for was was to formulate an agreement even before submitting the proposal within the erasmus mundus program was to have an agreement with a university in u k and another agreement with a university er in er portugal
POwgd317:894	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd317:895	S2:	 and this agreement was a general one it was not a very very general one it was more detailed hh than the general ones that we have er because it specified in the agreement that w- erm this agreement would allow us to collaborate er within the erasmus mundus program and we will have a change of students and mobility of students hh a mobility of staff and the international office will be in charge of of er of the stud- of the exchange students hh it was more detailed but this was done in as a first step hh in order to continue the discussion and the talks hh with their partner universities

POwgd317:962	S1:	 mhm

POwgd317:1198	S1:	 yeah but that's should be a question as well i mean if it's at all possible erm because of your national legislation if the person can be accepted to the program itself especially if the student does not come from one of the participating universities i mean how do you where does the person actually get enroled at the program or at one university or all three universities hh i mean there are

POwgd317:1348	S1:	 erm yeah

POwgd317:1371	S4:	 even if it is concerning e-methods so it's er anyway it's er related to studies

POwgd317:1373	S2:	 what about quality assurance think this is quite important 
POwgd317:1374	S1:	 true but i think that administration will have to organize it but still it has to be agreed between the academics
POwgd317:1375	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1376	S1:	 how to do it 
POwgd317:1377	S2:	 all the processes i mean
POwgd317:1378	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1379	S2:	 in order to check whether all the processes are of you know standard quality or 
POwgd317:1380	S1:	 but but perhaps there should be a question on on the questionnaire how do you carry out quality assurance today 
POwgd317:1381	S2:	 yeah within your own institution
POwgd317:1382	S1:	 yeah do you do only internal 
POwgd317:1383	S2:	 or if you want to yeah 
POwgd317:1384	S1:	 evaluation or external do you do accreditation
POwgd317:1385	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1386	S2:	 do you have quality assurance for er er international relations if you want to be more specific
POwgd317:1387	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1388	S2:	 because some universities t- have for research others they don't other have hh er others er other university have er quality assurance for er er international relations other don't other don- they don't have at all 
POwgd317:1389	S5:	 okay so i've put down how do you carry out quality assurance sounds a bit st- strange but still do you have quality assurance for international relations
POwgd317:1390	S4:	 activities 
POwgd317:1391	S1:	 you cou- you could perhaps say after the first question 
POwgd317:1392	S2:	 xxx 
POwgd317:1393	S1:	 do you do some of the points that were listed as as internal external evaluation is it hh quality assu- erm er well is it is it accreditation erm how do you do it
POwgd317:1394	S4:	 but some some er related questions that are asked on the status quo are also 
POwgd317:1395	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1396	S4:	 just a question of er quality assurance i think i if i remember correct 
POwgd317:1397	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1398	S2:	 i don't remember the status quo 
POwgd317:1399	S4:	 but something was er asked also in the sta- status quo
POwgd317:1400	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1401	S4:	 i don't have it with me 
POwgd317:1402	S5:	 i'm a bit lost now i have to say because i have to think about so many things at the same time at the moment 
POwgd317:1403	S2:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd317:1404	S5:	 er the question is how what we're going to present now and er er i mean we we generally have to d- agree on hh on on a point er and say you know we can go today we can g- go until hh this point and not further and this is open questions and this still needs to be discussed
POwgd317:1405	S1:	 true and then also i mean in terms of [S7]'s insistence on the process i mean it's difficult to describe when there're so many different approaches in in in the various 
POwgd317:1406	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd317:1407	S1:	 countries
POwgd317:1408	S5:	 exactly exactly 
POwgd317:1409	S1:	 so er i think we'll have to do some work on the questionnaire and actually structuring it so it's so you get solid answers out of it and then perhaps figure out a way to put it into a matrix
POwgd317:1410	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:1411	S1:	 in that respect you can actually see 
POwgd317:1412	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd317:1413	S1:	 that'll help 
POwgd317:1414	S2:	 you can compare between each university

POwgd317:1418	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd317:1419	S1:	 i think
