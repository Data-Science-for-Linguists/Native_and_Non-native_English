            <note xml:id="PBpan25_tn_0">This panel discussion is part of an international investor
               conference. It deals with the economic situation of the South-eastern European member
               states of the EU and their potential accession to the European monetary union. The
               event starts with statements of the panellists, followed by discussion among the
               panellists and then questions from the audience. S1 chairs the panel. S2, S3, S4, S5,
               S6, S7 and S8 are the panellists. S9, S10 and S11 are audience members posing
               questions. The issues discussed broadly relate to advantages and disadvantages
               connected to entering the European monetary union as soon as possible. The panellists
               discuss different strategies of different countries opt. As there is a large
               audience, there are various background noises throughout the event (like coughing,
               clearing of throat, murmuring). Due to the large audience, the speakers talk into
               microphones. </note>
