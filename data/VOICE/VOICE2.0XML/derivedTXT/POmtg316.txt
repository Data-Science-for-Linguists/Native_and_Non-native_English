POmtg316:1	S1:	 let's starts with er the academic part the aca- er academic with
POmtg316:2	SX-m:	 yeah 
POmtg316:3	S1:	 okay er that was just er again er brainstorming more than a very structured discussing but we have arrived at a certain er a structure of the questions that should be raised er before the actual project is started so the first batch of questions that is what are the objectives and the backgrounds to the projects what is the objective the new the novel aspect that we are going that you are going to develop that is what is the added value of the joint er master mas- joint master's er program secondly what are the labor market needs er thirdly what sort of professional skills are needed and then what learning outcomes that is generic and specific competences erm are to be developed as a result of the program what is the best sort of the pool of knowledge and experience that would contribute to the attainment of the objectives why are you laughing at me 
POmtg316:4	S2:	 no he's trying to sort of follow you @
POmtg316:5	SX-9:	 yeah 
POmtg316:6	SS:	 @@@
POmtg316:7	SX-f:	 @
POmtg316:8	S3:	 maybe you should speak slower 
POmtg316:9	S4:	 no no no that's o- that's okay x 
POmtg316:10	S3:	 okay 
POmtg316:11	S1:	 and finally finally 
POmtg316:12	SX-f:	 @@@@
POmtg316:13	S5:	 @@@@ @
POmtg316:14	S1:	 at er at the time being because the list is not going to be er complete before i don't know the next two or three months how are you we the th- the the consortium how are you going to contribute to the erm to the er execution of the program that is how the expertise is going to be divided among the participating institutions 
POmtg316:15	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:16	S1:	 or what what should be the contribution of each participating institution as far as their expertise is concerned the second er batch of questions to be asked er refer to curriculum structure and content and er the questions that we have arrived er at n- n- not in the chronological order but as they have er come up in the discussion er what does the curriculum look like or what is what is it going to look like what is the proportion of obligatory optional and elective er courses or modules the length of the pro- what is the length of the program er what is the length extent and weights of the thesis erm what is the proportion of the existing modules er towards er the new modules which have been created e- -specially for the purpose of this particular joint program er in the context of the thesis also 
POmtg316:17	SX:	
POmtg316:18	S1:	 how is the thesis going to be supervised how what are the assessment crite- criteria and er methods 
POmtg316:19	SX:	 hhh 
POmtg316:20	S1:	 erm will there be any internships or place- placements er provided what courses are to be offered and who will offer them who will be who will teach the courses er what teaching methods will be applied erm next whether the e-learning method will be used will there be x courses or intensive courses or summer schools 
POmtg316:21	SX:	
POmtg316:22	S1:	 is there an educational platform and who is running it who will offer it as a part

POmtg316:24	S1:	 of the erm 
POmtg316:25	SX-5:	
POmtg316:26	S1:	 of the what teaching tool what are the assessment methods and grading schemes 
POmtg316:27	SX:	
POmtg316:28	S1:	 and then there was the question of tutoring wi- will will there be tutoring in place as well as a as a teaching method the third batch of questions will consist er will concern mobility both staff mobility and student mobility 
POmtg316:29	SX:	 hhh 
POmtg316:30	S1:	 er such questions have er resulted erm how will a period of study completed in a partner institution be recognized in the home institution what will be the extent of optional slash compulsory er mobility within the x erm what proportion of the curriculum er will be covered er by a guest teaching professor by by a guest teaching staff i said here so by a guest professor what proportion of program is realized would be realized abroad we have thought thought the- the- the- the- the- there were voices like that here that at least one semester should be executed abroad that is thirty credit points but perhaps this is too categorical too rigorous 
POmtg316:31	SX:	 hm 
POmtg316:32	S1:	 it will depend on er financial resources and opportunities and next batch of questions concern language policy 
POmtg316:33	S5:	 admission cr- criteria 
POmtg316:34	S1:	 what 
POmtg316:35	SX-f:	 admission criteria mhm 
POmtg316:36	SX:	
POmtg316:37	S1:	 yeah put language er above admission criteria but 
POmtg316:38	S5:	 er 
POmtg316:39	S5:	 hm 
POmtg316:40	S1:	 m- maybe the order in is not er the right one we can restructure it and reorder it anyway language policy 
POmtg316:41	S5:	 oh 
POmtg316:42	S1:	 concerns er language of instruction and language of examination what will be the language of instruction and what will be the language languages of examination maybe languages of instruction 
POmtg316:43	S2:	 good idea 
POmtg316:44	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg316:45	S1:	 er do you give or are you going to give er credits for for language courses will there be any language assistance or languages consultancy er available what will be the language of er of the thesis will there be local language courses available fee-paying or free of charge extra or or er obligatory perhaps next batch concerns admission and the questions to be asked are as follows what are the admission criteria who makes admission decisions what qualifications and qualities of students are required what is the volume and composition of er student corp
POmtg316:46	S5:	
POmtg316:47	S1:	 whether and how do you restrict inverted commas access so what are the specific er admission criteria which would er allow for successful selection of the best that is er t- t- t- the preferred er population of students erm whether any language certification or er on entrance or language competence are are formal language competence cerp- certification is required and then the last i think for the time being quality assurance issues whether and what quality assurance mechanism are in place erm what internal and external er matters 
POmtg316:48	S5:	 mhm 
POmtg316:49	S1:	 er i s- i said quality assurance methods are used whether it's an ongoing process will the courses be accredited will the program be accredited externally hh erm they thesis will it be erm also externally examined will there be an external examiner hh erm another do you foresee any mechanism for innovation and revision of programs and that's it more or less shall i or have i skipped something or omitted

POmtg316:101	S10:	 @
POmtg316:102	S4:	 and we thought of quite a lot of the hh sort of er quite complex questions that that we felt had a very much a national context to it so we thought of doing a questionnaire very much in the same as prior to our last meeting here with this status quo report of the bologna process we thought of doing another one but nearly aimed directly at the joint degrees er and program scheme so we thought of once we return these questions perhaps we could do a matrix in which we had all the countries and then all the issues here and you could xx check it out and erm for interesting departments they could actually take it and see well perhaps we have five interesting universities which of those or which two or three would be most relevant to us in terms of how we are able to do things and how they are so in terms of funding er we listed that we need to be able to provide information on external national and institutional funding external could be what we viewed as being e u in terms of erasmus and socrates and perhaps marie curie and also if nordic countries are involved we know of er the nordic council er and nordplus which erm sometimes supports erm schemes like these hh in terms of national funding i mean er this is one of those things that we would have to ask in a in a questionnaire because it varies erm erm wa- er was it [place1] or is 
POmtg316:103	S3:	 [place1] yes 
POmtg316:104	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg316:105	S4:	 yah [place1] 
POmtg316:106	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg316:107	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg316:108	S4:	 have some sort of funding 
POmtg316:109	S3:	 yes 
POmtg316:110	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg316:111	S4:	 erm so we would simply have to ask about it and at the institutional level we thought of that it c- it could comprise of two things either tuition fees which varies of course as well so we need to ask about that or for instance if there's a a a lump sum of money erm stacked away for for developing joint programs for instance if it's a high priority for the rectorate they could take some money of the general budget and put it into 
POmtg316:112	SX-1:	 yah 
POmtg316:113	S4:	 actually exploring and experimenting with with er with joint programs so we have formulated some questions that could be put in for this in terms of funding then we have the contracts and agreements and we thought that there should be two steps initially 
POmtg316:114	S2:	 can i still ask about funding erm 
POmtg316:115	S4:	 xxx 
POmtg316:116	S2:	 cos there's there seems to be two er sets of funding or two stages of funding one is for the for these projects and another one is for the degree programs and we need to be clear what we are talking about er for the projects i think we are all trying to find funding er for the development phase and we're trying to sort of look look at different ways and also su- suggesting 
POmtg316:117	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:118	S2:	 but for the sustainable er running of projects 
POmtg316:119	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:120	S2:	 for the er the degree programs 
POmtg316:121	S1:	 programs 
POmtg316:122	SX-3:	 implementation xx 
POmtg316:123	S2:	 they will need to to to allot on their own er and that is th- that is the most crucial question under this i think it's for the [org1] er [org2] or whatever structure i think it's more important for us to find ways also and help them in finding ways or 
POmtg316:124	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:125	S2:	 doing the applications ourselves 
POmtg316:126	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:127	S2:	 for those things so this erm 
POmtg316:128	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:129	S2:	 clarification i think is necessary because for the for sustai- for the sustainable part it can never be outside project-borne funding that needs to be sort of clear 
POmtg316:130	S4:	 right i don't know why we wrote [org1] criteria under the second 
POmtg316:131	S10:	 er because basically we thought well this was just a i don't know whether we can really regard this as relevant for contracts and agreements but generally we hope that the er six criteria established by the [org1] task force criteria is the very basis er f- is is the basic document for also the contracts and the agreements that should be developed between they the the groups so firs- as first er thing we have the the the the the criteria and then er erm it has to be agreed on individually by the consortia anyway 
POmtg316:132	S4:	 yeah and as i said we we could contemplate er on two steps more or less initially a letter of intent erm signed or memorandum o- of understanding head of faculty dean or rector could sign these it wouldn't 
POmtg316:133	SX-f:	 xx 
POmtg316:134	S4:	 really be very specific but it would sort of say we are further investigating the opportunities to sort of do this thing 
POmtg316:135	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:136	S4:	 then we could have a letter of commitment or er 
POmtg316:137	S3:	 a signed agreement 
POmtg316:138	S4:	 yah 
POmtg316:139	S3:	 a final agreement signed 
POmtg316:140	S10:	 after having settled all the
POmtg316:141	S4:	 yah 
POmtg316:142	S3:	 yah 
POmtg316:143	S10:	 after hav- er having agreed on the contract and everything 
POmtg316:144	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg316:145	S4:	 yes xx we felt 
POmtg316:146	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:147	S3:	 the course content 
POmtg316:148	S4:	 yeah felt it was important that it was signed by a rector sort of to show the institutional backing er and it was really the main elements of this agreement er slight extent the topic areas just that the other subgroup just presented matters of funding admission procedures duration of the program where does it start where does it finish 
POmtg316:149	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:150	SX:	
POmtg316:151	S4:	 amount of e c t s and if the e c t s grading scale is used what type of exams and subsequent assessments are in place how many courses are offered and who is responsible what quality mechanisms are in place what type of degree is given so it's really very much the same perhaps it shouldn't be in the contract itself but then it perhaps er er it should be in a in an appendix 
POmtg316:152	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:153	S4:	 erm to it 
POmtg316:154	S1:	 that should be put in durable form not just words xx but 
POmtg316:155	S4:	 hm true yah yah 
POmtg316:156	S1:	 document 
POmtg316:157	S3:	 yah 
POmtg316:158	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:159	S2:	 er can i can i ask because there seems to be also again erm parts of the things that you've listed are relevant for the development part and some other parts are relevant for 
POmtg316:160	SX-1:	 hm 
POmtg316:161	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:162	S2:	 them to discuss erm for the sustainable program part 
POmtg316:163	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:164	S2:	 like for example you said initially some sort of letter of intent 
POmtg316:165	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:166	S2:	 that would be for the 
POmtg316:167	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg316:168	S2:	 for the
POmtg316:169	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg316:170	S2:	 for the process part 
POmtg316:171	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg316:172	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:173	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg316:174	S2:	 so you see this these are the things that i was trying to sort of make a distinction between the process and the process of developing 
POmtg316:175	SX-1:	
POmtg316:176	S10:	 but what do you think 
POmtg316:177	S4:	 but but but it this is their sort of the headlines in contracts and agreements and and they would have to be entered before a program is actually up and running so this would have to be before but er all very important issues that need to be addressed before a program can actually go into existence 
POmtg316:178	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:179	S4:	 i would think 
POmtg316:180	S2:	 yeah but before they even start they would not i mean when they start discussing then hh i think there was like initial what did you say initial intent 
POmtg316:181	S4:	 initially it was letter of intent simply half a page perhaps all the rest which is the paramount part of this was actually the the written agreement the one that actually says all right after we've signed this we can go on we can actually start 
POmtg316:182	S8:	 but er prac- practically speaking erm 
POmtg316:183	S1:	 yeah so 
POmtg316:184	S4:	 oh it doesn't really matter you'd only have one really 
POmtg316:185	S8:	 yeah because 
POmtg316:186	S4:	 one agreement 
POmtg316:187	S8:	 i i i think you know in terms of workload you know we we tend to just to have one you know agreement and 
POmtg316:188	S2:	 absolutely 
POmtg316:189	S8:	 not to make two you know like 
POmtg316:190	S4:	 no well but yes 
POmtg316:191	S8:	 cos it's 
POmtg316:192	S1:	 well sha- shall we talk about er shall we speak about project phase and a program phase project is 
POmtg316:193	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg316:194	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:195	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg316:196	S1:	 is this er 
POmtg316:197	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:198	S1:	 process towards 
POmtg316:199	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg316:200	S1:	 erm creating a program which will be run and managed 
POmtg316:201	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg316:202	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:203	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:204	S1:	 so when we are talking about a project we are talking about processes 
POmtg316:205	S2:	 yes 
POmtg316:206	S1:	 am i right
POmtg316:207	S2:	 yes 
POmtg316:208	S1:	 [S2] 
POmtg316:209	S2:	 yes exactly 
POmtg316:210	S1:	 and the program starts with the letter of intent maybe
POmtg316:211	S2:	 no it has to have a 
POmtg316:212	S9:	 project starts with a letter 
POmtg316:213	S1:	 xx project
POmtg316:214	S3:	 yeah yeah the project starts 
POmtg316:215	S9:	 i would say yeah 
POmtg316:216	SX-2:	 yeah 
POmtg316:217	S3:	 the negotiations negotiations start 
POmtg316:218	S9:	 and because of of that er x 
POmtg316:219	SX-2:	 xxxxxxx 
POmtg316:220	S1:	 does it have to be 
POmtg316:221	S1:	 does or or or or or perhaps the project is concluded with a letter of intent 
POmtg316:222	S9:	 oh perhaps yes 
POmtg316:223	S3:	 no 
POmtg316:224	S1:	 because you don't need to discuss 
POmtg316:225	SX:	 no 
POmtg316:226	S9:	 right 
POmtg316:227	SX-f:	 yes 
POmtg316:228	S1:	 with a formal letter 
POmtg316:229	S5:	 hm hh 
POmtg316:230	S1:	 we can start negotiating and talking and discussing 
POmtg316:231	S9:	 yeah 
POmtg316:232	S9:	 much more er er er er referring to the [first name1]'s 
POmtg316:233	S1:	 xxx 
POmtg316:234	S9:	 to [last name1]'s er information there will be two phases one is in which you come to the pool of the potential [org1] program this is a preparati- per- preparatory period this is 
POmtg316:235	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:236	S9:	 general discussing and then you start the realization after after getting label 
POmtg316:237	S10:	 yeah basic 
POmtg316:238	S9:	 or so that there are in fact two applications 
POmtg316:239	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:240	S9:	 pre-application and er 
POmtg316:241	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:242	S9:	 and er fi- i mean full application 
POmtg316:243	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:244	S9:	 main applicati- something like that yah 
POmtg316:245	S10:	 i mean 
POmtg316:246	S9:	 this is a experience until now 
POmtg316:247	S10:	 er 
POmtg316:248	S9:	 although not very ver- very very very ve- very much regulated but this is more or less the way of

POmtg316:250	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:251	S9:	 xx 
POmtg316:252	S4:	 but if this were to be a manual for good practice 
POmtg316:253	SX-1:	 hm 
POmtg316:254	S4:	 for people who are initially interested having no clue about how to develop 
POmtg316:255	S9:	 er right 
POmtg316:256	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg316:257	S4:	 a joint program perhaps it is mostly in the project phase then that this manual should be concentrated and focused on and not how you maintain or sustain a program already running 
POmtg316:258	SX-7:	
POmtg316:259	S10:	 this is what we have to find out and learn from the projects anyway and from but i think what we meant also with letter of er 
POmtg316:260	S8:	 intent 
POmtg316:261	S10:	 intent is is is probably not something that should be created by the consortia but really very much by all [org1] universities er together i mean there should be something er like a general agreement signed by the rectors which says okay we as [org1] members we are interested 
POmtg316:262	S8:	 okay 
POmtg316:263	S8:	 yes 
POmtg316:264	S10:	 in developing joint degrees otherwise you'd have i mean people er if you if you er if you kind of talk to people ti- er why these er in the developing phase at the moment they can er it's likely that they get frustrated as well if they put much workload in it and much effort in it without actually having a guarantee or any any er kind of er document that tells them okay we we we support the general idea so maybe we should ask 
POmtg316:265	S9:	 yah 
POmtg316:266	S10:	 er as [first name1] has mentioned 
POmtg316:267	S9:	 rectors 
POmtg316:268	S10:	 what are the issues that we want from [ORG1] as well maybe we should er underline and stress the importance of a general agreement between all the rectors of [org1] universities that they wanna do that want to develop [org1] 
POmtg316:269	SX:	
POmtg316:270	S10:	 er joint masters 
POmtg316:271	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:272	S1:	 does this need to be in a written form is it not a passive agreement i mean once we are in [org1] and we developed a a a common policy 
POmtg316:273	S10:	 yeah but what about what about 
POmtg316:274	S1:	 xxxxxxx 
POmtg316:275	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:276	S9:	 yeah but if there are some obligations financial obligations for ch- ea- from each university so one thing is to x a proclamation about 
POmtg316:277	S8:	 but the the f- 
POmtg316:278	S9:	 general cooperation within [org1] another thing is to make obligation 
POmtg316:279	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg316:280	S9:	 towards er real 
POmtg316:281	S8:	 but that's i think er l- like y- you said like a letter of intent something like that may facilitate maybe some you know s- some of the the preparation or 
POmtg316:282	S5:	 yes 
POmtg316:283	S8:	 you know some of the legal background 
POmtg316:284	S1:	 mhm but 
POmtg316:285	S8:	 so it could be used like that i think 
POmtg316:286	S10:	 to have your to have the situation in [place2] for example i mean 
POmtg316:287	SX-f:	 x 
POmtg316:288	S10:	 whe- w- where where where where we've just learned this morning that it's simply not possible or or or 
POmtg316:289	SX-8:	 yah 
POmtg316:290	S10:	 that there is legal obstacles that er that prevent er er us from from developing it maybe a a l- a letter or an official document could could reinforce this procedure 
POmtg316:291	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg316:292	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg316:293	S5:	 i think that er the best will be if er [org1] rector are signing a general letter of intent saying that they are ready to put in er in force er er erm erm a project for master in general speaking 
POmtg316:294	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:295	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:296	S5:	 so erm we have already their expression of intent that they 
POmtg316:297	SX-f:	 commitment 
POmtg316:298	S5:	 support in this case no the the process of the master 
POmtg316:299	SX-9:	
POmtg316:300	S5:	 and then time by time the project will be approved if this er project complies with all the regulation that er we are setting now i think that er if [org1] succeed and do this it will be really a success 
POmtg316:301	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:302	S5:	 once forever forever for the next years obviously 
POmtg316:303	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:304	S5:	 to achieve the le- er the letter of a general intent of the rector 
POmtg316:305	SX-4:	 hm 
POmtg316:306	S5:	 it is their engagement 
POmtg316:307	SX-10:	 xxx 
POmtg316:308	S5:	 strong engagement 
POmtg316:309	SX-10:	 xxxxx 
POmtg316:310	S4:	 i think that's a very good idea 
POmtg316:311	S5:	 er thi- this must be er my my vision the best er 
POmtg316:312	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg316:313	S5:	 [S10] this depend er on the xx @@ if er is er so clever to convince them it will be useful 
POmtg316:314	SX-3:	 but er my my 
POmtg316:315	SX-3:	 my er 
POmtg316:316	SX-2:	 x has this been discussed in xxxx 
POmtg316:317	SX-4:	 x general
POmtg316:318	S3:	 general assembly it was discussed
POmtg316:319	S10:	 no er 
POmtg316:320	S5:	
POmtg316:321	S1:	 not x xx 
POmtg316:322	S10:	 not at the rectors' conference either 
POmtg316:323	SX-f:	 no 
POmtg316:324	S8:	 my question is now let's say your rector is if you know that the policy in your country prevents you from having this kind of joint degrees then can you sign such a letter of intent i don't think you can 
POmtg316:325	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg316:326	S8:	 since you know that you have you know xx 
POmtg316:327	S4:	 well it's an ongoing struggle and battle 
POmtg316:328	S8:	 hm 
POmtg316:329	S4:	 and erm the law i mean clearly the minister perhaps can be persuaded or he can be changed 
POmtg316:330	S5:	 hm hm hm 
POmtg316:331	S8:	 yes 
POmtg316:332	S4:	 and he can be replaced by someone who has a more favorable so i think we'd have no problem of signing a letter of intent 
POmtg316:333	S8:	 okay 
POmtg316:334	S4:	 erm but of course we would also have to be honest er about how realistically it is 
POmtg316:335	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg316:336	S4:	 and i'm i'm not sure at all 
POmtg316:337	S5:	 hm 
POmtg316:338	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:339	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg316:340	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:341	S4:	 and perhaps 
POmtg316:342	S8:	 yes it's a letter of intent it's not 
POmtg316:343	S4:	 hm
POmtg316:344	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg316:345	S8:	 you know something compulsory or 
POmtg316:346	SX-f:	 letter of commitment 
POmtg316:347	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg316:348	S4:	 right 
POmtg316:349	S8:	 hm 
POmtg316:350	S4:	 erm well then we have the mobility and perhaps not really distinguishing between the the planning phase or the actual program phase it would have to consider how to organize mobility in terms of housing language courses welfare orientation administration registration hh erm and both in terms of student and teachers' mobility 
POmtg316:351	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:352	S4:	 and also for staff mobility 
POmtg316:353	SX-1:	 hm 
POmtg316:354	S4:	 non-academic 
POmtg316:355	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:356	S4:	 i think it's obvious that if you have erm administrative personnel seeing how their sort of counterparts in the within the same program actually deals with things be it could be inspiring 
POmtg316:357	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:358	S5:	 hm 
POmtg316:359	S4:	 so and perhaps do an internship for a couple of weeks 
POmtg316:360	S5:	 hm 
POmtg316:361	S4:	 or a group placement erm so 
POmtg316:362	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:363	S4:	 in terms of admission procedures perhaps it's more an academic question er but it should be very clear whether the student is admitted to the program itself or to any of the participating universities or all three universities 
POmtg316:364	SX-1:	 yeah 
POmtg316:365	S4:	 and if it's a student not originating from one of the three universities actually doing the program er which university is the student then admitted to or can he be admitted also due to national legislation to a program itself which is actually pan-european rather than national er this is an issues that needs to be resolved erm right hh erm and then should there be reciprocity in in this program 
POmtg316:366	SX-1:	 mhm hm 
POmtg316:367	S4:	 should a country saying erm all right we deliver perhaps twenty per cent of all the teaching we deliver fifteen per cent of all the students so we will only accept fifteen per cent coming to our university or so erm sort of get the expectations settled before the program actually gets running so and should there be selection criteria and xxx x put forward by and i suppose that would be the academics hh right hh quality assurance yeah well that was really we have organization of teaching grading system terms e c t s quality assurance organization of consortium
POmtg316:368	S3:	 diploma supplement 
POmtg316:369	S8:	 diploma supplement 
POmtg316:370	S4:	 diploma supplement 
POmtg316:371	S8:	 yeah we've talked about it as well 
POmtg316:372	S4:	 yes where do we put that in tha- that was a part of the quality assurance 
POmtg316:373	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg316:374	S4:	 no yeah 
POmtg316:375	S3:	 recognition

POmtg316:377	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg316:378	S3:	 xxx 
POmtg316:379	S4:	 right yeah that was really it was really brainstorming it didn't @ come to any explanation as to sort of this is how to do it er 
POmtg316:380	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg316:381	S1:	 well i imagine that er

POmtg316:383	S1:	 tomorrow after well brief presentation of these er years as i have said to [S10] it will be put on the web and open to discussion 
POmtg316:384	S4:	 hm 
POmtg316:385	S1:	 for some input and then eventually perhaps we give the list of questions er to a xxx 
POmtg316:386	S10:	 hh yeah i mean i think it would be very helpful if we were very precise about how we think that this task force should continue
POmtg316:387	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:388	S10:	 er its its work and er what should be the next steps 
POmtg316:389	S1:	 yes are we are we er expected to write the manual 
POmtg316:390	S8:	 i think that's well i think that's part of the project 
POmtg316:391	S1:	 which project 
POmtg316:392	S5:	 xx 
POmtg316:393	S8:	 er about joint you know joint degrees you know if y- if we because what's the what's 
POmtg316:394	S1:	 but we as a task force 
POmtg316:395	S8:	 wh- what's the poi- but who who who will write the m- 
POmtg316:396	S1:	 how far shall we go this was my initial question 
POmtg316:397	S8:	 but then who who will write the manual then 
POmtg316:398	S1:	 exactly 
POmtg316:399	SS:	 @@@
POmtg316:400	S8:	 you know if we don't do it then who will do it 
POmtg316:401	S1:	 yes 
POmtg316:402	S8:	 because we've have 
POmtg316:403	S1:	 do we do it in our spare time or for money 
POmtg316:404	S10:	 yeah exactly that's that's i think that's questions that we should address i'm i think that we should come up with the 
POmtg316:405	S8:	 okay that's 
POmtg316:406	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:407	S1:	 yeah because 
POmtg316:408	S10:	 ideas that we'd have and ho- the way we wanna proceed and the way we er we have to continue our work and xxx for that 
POmtg316:409	S1:	 the point on the agenda is very er 
POmtg316:410	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:411	S1:	 broad i mean how is the group going to proceed and what does the member of the group or what depends on the group's decision 
POmtg316:412	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:413	SX:	 ooph 
POmtg316:414	S11:	 erm and there's another question 
POmtg316:415	SX-f:	 cos 
POmtg316:416	S11:	 and then just another questio- another question because erm neither germany or england is represented in in this group 
POmtg316:417	S3:	 or france 
POmtg316:418	S11:	 and of course their systems are really different from 
POmtg316:419	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:420	S11:	 i think most of our countries have a mis- ministry of education that sort of 
POmtg316:421	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:422	S11:	 decides a bit more than it does in those countries 
POmtg316:423	SX-1:	 mhm 
POmtg316:424	S11:	 so that's er that makes other sorts of problems as well 
POmtg316:425	S10:	 but er we should i mean one way out of this is at least to get an idea of what happens in other countries is really to develop a questionnaire that we've just addressed 
POmtg316:426	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg316:427	S10:	 that should provide the basis for for for a matrix then or for a summary of the exhib- of the er of several institutions erm maybe we should really come up maybe that that's er one aspect that that certain we need other [org1] institutions to to join 
POmtg316:428	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg316:429	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg316:430	S9:	 i understood that tomorrow both groups will give some reports and then er there will be under the consideration discussion of all 
POmtg316:431	S1:	 a discussion 
POmtg316:432	S10:	 yes

POmtg316:434	S9:	 [org2] and then er 
POmtg316:435	SS:	 xxxx

POmtg316:481	S5:	 er er er [S10] sorry there is another point perhaps er general point er in presenting the project we can er think for example three different universities and this does- don't means that in the future other university may enter so i think that we can also introduce this possibility because in this way we can also to think that may cooperate in the project universi- that now are not ready to enter for legal reason and so on but they are er are in agreement er er with the contents of the master and so on er they may enter at full title when it will be possible in the future
