EDint331:2	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:3	S1:	 and analyze xx so that we can see where we can plot our exams 
EDint331:4	S2:	 yes yes i see 
EDint331:5	S1:	 okay erm 
EDint331:6	S2:	 and actually i was er i prepared some questions for you
EDint331:7	S1:	 yeah okay 
EDint331:8	S2:	 hm 
EDint331:9	S1:	 er but er i didn't catch your name 
EDint331:10	S2:	 er [S2] it's [S2] 
EDint331:11	S1:	 [S2] okay 
EDint331:12	S2:	 yes so i'm in- in- investigating the present linguistic situation i am doing the a comparative study of the study done twenty years ago
EDint331:13	S1:	 mhm 
EDint331:14	S2:	 er by mazzon maybe you you came across it hh and er 
EDint331:15	S1:	 aha 
EDint331:16	S2:	 i want to know whether the linguistic situation has changed whether english has declined 
EDint331:17	S1:	 in twenty years @@
EDint331:18	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:19	S1:	 hm okay er so er so it's a it's not er you're not only interested in maltese it's on- also in english
EDint331:20	S2:	 both both languages 
EDint331:21	S1:	 both languages okay as they are used in malta all right fair enough yes 
EDint331:22	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:23	S2:	 yes exactly 
EDint331:24	S1:	 so you 
EDint331:25	S2:	 yes so i would like to know what's your er opinion what's er how do you see the present linguistic situation whether something has changed erm 
EDint331:26	S1:	 over the past twenty years or 
EDint331:27	S2:	 yes yes exactly 
EDint331:28	S1:	 er well er many things have changed 
EDint331:29	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:30	S1:	 legally linguistically speaking there is a much faster change now then there was twenty years ago 
EDint331:31	S2:	 yes yes 
EDint331:32	S1:	 erm but let me start with the bit where you said what is the present situation 
EDint331:33	S2:	 yes yes yes 
EDint331:34	S1:	 now in malta okay erm most of us obviously who use maltese 
EDint331:35	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:36	S1:	 erm we use english continuously for instance what i'm doing here it's all in english because the the the seminars and the conferences that er we have to participate in they are all in english okay so at the moment i would say erm that both languages are being used very frequently
EDint331:37	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:38	S1:	 but in different spheres there are certain areas where maltese is predominant 
EDint331:39	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:40	S1:	 and certain areas where english is predominant but what happens is this you get institutions like the banks like er the insurance agenc- agencies erm large er departments and they carry most of their business in english 
EDint331:41	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:42	S1:	 but because of this awareness on the more on on the fact they have to use maltese more 
EDint331:43	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:44	S1:	 they are trying to translate most of their stuff into maltese 
EDint331:45	S2:	 yes hh 
EDint331:46	S1:	 okay
EDint331:47	S2:	 and since when is this happening 
EDint331:48	S1:	 well largely it was er a push by the fact that we entered the er european union 
EDint331:49	S2:	 oh i see i see 
EDint331:50	S1:	 okay so er this has been going on for the past er two years 
EDint331:51	S2:	 yes i see 
EDint331:52	S1:	 mostly 
EDint331:53	S2:	 oh that's very valuable to know 
EDint331:54	S1:	 yes 
EDint331:55	S2:	 because it's a it's a very recent change and a very recent development 
EDint331:56	S1:	 that's right yes and and and the er the er membership the e u membership has really erm produced a lot of output in translation works
EDint331:57	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:58	S1:	 which eventually erm er resulted in showing that maltese can be important you see erm 
EDint331:59	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:60	S1:	 there there was a erm hh an uncomfortable attitude by some of us 
EDint331:61	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:62	S1:	 that maltese was not important 
EDint331:63	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:64	S1:	 why do you need such a small nation's language when you can only use it in these few square kilometres 
EDint331:65	S2:	 @@@
EDint331:66	S1:	 understand
EDint331:67	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:68	S1:	 we never we never thought that our our language could be used on a continent
EDint331:69	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:70	S1:	 we knew that it could be taken abroad with our emigrants like those in australia and in canada 
EDint331:71	S2:	 yes i see 
EDint331:72	S1:	 okay and there are communities even in in paris maltese communities who try to keep their language alive 
EDint331:73	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:74	S1:	 you understand in sydney melbourne and and er 
EDint331:75	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:76	S1:	 toronto okay but we never up till two or three years ago we never thought that europe could be interested in in promoting our language 
EDint331:77	S2:	 yes yes yes 
EDint331:78	S1:	 and then when they when we realized that it was going to be an official language erm 
EDint331:79	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:80	S1:	 well people were delighted but apart from that economically it generated a lot of work in fact i would say the translation has grew er actually mushroomed into an industry
EDint331:81	S2:	 really
EDint331:82	S2:	 mhm 
EDint331:83	S1:	 er erm even the university had to rush into 
EDint331:84	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:85	S1:	 producing interpreters and and and translators okay
EDint331:86	S2:	 hh so would you say that the european union played a crucial role for for this language awareness
EDint331:87	S1:	 yes yes 
EDint331:88	S2:	 and what else er could you could you maybe think of the reason what else could have influenced er the rise of maltese in the la- in the past er let's say five

EDint331:94	S2:	 yes @@
EDint331:95	S1:	 erm progress contributed a lot to the growth of maltese because we actually discovered that erm we could really express ourselves in maltese
EDint331:96	S2:	 yes

EDint331:98	S2:	 yes

EDint331:101	S1:	 all right in a maltese 
EDint331:102	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:103	S1:	 i have been an en- er er an editor of the most important almost encyclopaedia where we have produced er a seventy-two volume encyclopaedia in which each volume treats a different subject and we've had astronomy navigation shipbuilding er gardening er flora lepidoptera

EDint331:109	S1:	 i- it was er er a combined er work by about sixty people okay
EDint331:110	S2:	 ah okay i see 
EDint331:111	S1:	 now now now in in terms of malta when you talk about sixty people doing such a project it's a large number because we're 
EDint331:112	S2:	 yes yes 
EDint331:113	S1:	 we're we don't have many experts understand
EDint331:114	S2:	 so you have managed to to translate all these technical terms 
EDint331:115	S1:	 no no the- these were not translated 
EDint331:116	S2:	 ah okay yes yes yes @
EDint331:117	S1:	 they just wrote them understand i can show you some of them over here 
EDint331:118	S2:	 okay hh 
EDint331:119	S2:	 i see i said translated because hh many people stick to er english technical terms when it comes to the subject you mentioned

EDint331:121	S1:	 yes 
EDint331:122	S1:	 yeah 
EDint331:123	S2:	 so
EDint331:124	S1:	 for example this is this is one of them because that's the the encyclopaedia that i am talking about it's about the the the maltese book 
EDint331:125	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:126	S1:	 you see so it talks about the development of er the maltese book obviously it starts er from er 
EDint331:127	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:128	S1:	 primitive times how people hh tried to put their ideas on stones or on clay 
EDint331:129	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:130	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:131	S1:	 on papyrus et cetera up to hh the present time i've got er er well these are the books that interest me but they are related to literature hh then i've got something about er music 
EDint331:132	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:133	S2:	 okay 
EDint331:134	S1:	 for example and and opera i think what this is what ah this this is the hh the sto- th- the- these are all 
EDint331:135	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:136	S2:	 ah 
EDint331:137	S1:	 like that the the encyclopaedia xxx all right the history of the opera in malta
EDint331:138	S2:	 yes yes 
EDint331:139	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:140	S1:	 this had never been done before 
EDint331:141	S2:	 okay 
EDint331:142	S2:	 so there you are er and this is only one of the volumes of course there are two one opera and two on music 
EDint331:143	S2:	 yes yes 
EDint331:144	S1:	 okay so this was written in maltese now this is an area which traditionally was and culturally was italian earlier 
EDint331:145	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:146	S1:	 er up till the nineteen century okay the er when people went to the theater they they saw plays and operas in italian
EDint331:147	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:148	S1:	 okay so culture up till nineteen century was in italian but er erm in this project we managed to to to collect all these things 
EDint331:149	S2:	 that's excellent 
EDint331:150	S1:	 yes even even astronomy for example astronomy was never written in maltese 
EDint331:151	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:152	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:153	S1:	 and with this project professor [last name1] who happens to be next door yeah hh he wrote 
EDint331:154	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:155	S2:	 aha 
EDint331:156	S1:	 er and described astronomy and he produced a volume like those 
EDint331:157	S2:	 mhm 
EDint331:158	S1:	 in maltese now i'm i'm i'm emphasizing this point because we grew up 
EDint331:159	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:160	S1:	 reading all these things in english 
EDint331:161	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:162	S1:	 researching all these things in english and all those people who wrote in this project their educational background was completely in english 
EDint331:163	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:164	S2:	 so when we came to write er my share was maltese literature er when we came to write we had to draw from that background
EDint331:165	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:166	S1:	 and we had to put it in maltese
EDint331:167	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:168	S1:	 okay well one of my job as hh er as an editor was to make sure that the maltese keeps on being f- er fluent 
EDint331:169	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:170	S1:	 understand
EDint331:171	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:172	S1:	 er we don't we didn't want it to be too rigid
EDint331:173	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:174	S1:	 yeah and and i didn't want it to sound that it was actually being translated huh
EDint331:175	S2:	 yes so n- as natural as possible 
EDint331:176	S1:	 and 
EDint331:177	S1:	 if possible yes even when you get something technical as technical as medicine for example 
EDint331:178	S2:	 okay 
EDint331:179	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:180	S1:	 okay it's er it's important that you see that er there's a continuous flow

EDint331:315	S1:	 and there is no F 
EDint331:316	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:317	S1:	 and yet they say that it's difficult and er they are very proud when they send their children in formtry secondary school and they start learning german and then you get er erm erm a a cluster of consonants there and they have only one sound and it doesn't matter that they that very often they mis- er er get a lot of mistakes there
EDint331:318	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:319	S1:	 but that's a effort in language so that's okay but when it comes to maltese hh if they have something that they can't tackle in the orthography then all hell breaks loose

EDint331:335	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:336	S1:	 that we had in the past the difference is this in the past say thirty forty years ago there were very few students studying er further education when i was at this university as an undergraduate there were practically there were barely five hundreds students in all

EDint331:338	S1:	 the faculties hh today er it it's reached almost ten thousand people 
EDint331:339	S2:	 really

EDint331:342	S1:	 throughout across the curriculum

EDint331:345	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:346	S1:	 right from the primary up till the tertiary level up yeah hh erm er but obviously since you've got more numbers then you're going to find that there are more failures

EDint331:629	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:630	S1:	 grown 
EDint331:631	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:632	S1:	 maltese has developed a lot and it's developing very fast okay erm i wouldn't say that english is suffering 
EDint331:633	S2:	 mhm 
EDint331:634	S1:	 because of maltese 
EDint331:635	S2:	 yes 
EDint331:636	S1:	 if english is suffering it could be because people are reading less 
EDint331:637	S2:	 yes yes yes 
EDint331:638	S1:	 okay but again i don't really believe that the standards of english are are are very low they could be decreasing because there are larger numbers understand
EDint331:639	S2:	 yes yes yes

EDint331:641	S2:	 yes
