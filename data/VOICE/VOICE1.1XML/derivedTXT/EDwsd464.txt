EDwsd464:60	S4:	 well of course every conference works in a different way and the first time as newcomers in [place3] in two thousand we just followed the general idea of our former president the dean of the [name1] universitaet at that time hh and that was pretty intense for almost a year we had a very large number of students who were interested in participating but the general design with the specific er subject working groups and so on hh was er er kind of developed at that time and i don't know how [place15] worked [S5] was there in in [place15] and she might tell more about how this worked hh and this time it's now th- a very specific

EDwsd464:63	S1:	 mhm they were they were yah yah 
EDwsd464:64	S4:	 everything related to european integration which followed more or less the agenda of what the european union does hh and so that changed 
EDwsd464:65	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:66	S4:	 er not only the selection of students and their interests but in general that we have a call in spring that there is a conference coming up and students can apply and then we have some sort of contest to select them 
EDwsd464:67	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:68	S4:	 and we start with a seminar which meets at least once a month and we make them prepare papers and discuss their findings and in the end it seemed at least in this conference that our students seemed to be so well prepared that when the forum started the input from the berliner seemed to be very concise and straightforward one which helped hopefully hh to get everything started cos the subjects were relatively broad and if you come up with a position and a clean message and a 
EDwsd464:69	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:70	SX-m:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:71	S4:	 political statement then this is of course food for thought to fuel the debate
EDwsd464:72	S1:	 mhm hh ho- 
EDwsd464:73	S4:	 but this is probably something which c- could be discussed about the requirements and so on cos hh er a- at a certain point it seemed as if we are the only ones who do this

EDwsd464:95	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:96	S5:	 so
EDwsd464:97	S1:	 so so the point is if if i understand that correctly that hh that when the preparation of the fora starts erm you need a kind of living person responsible for the forum so that st- that people have a rapport er and not just a a box where you put in your ideas 
EDwsd464:98	SX-f:	 mhm

EDwsd464:115	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:116	S5:	 and that also helped because then with the wi- th- we always said them okay th- the topic is so broad you could set the agenda try to to focus on what you y- would like s- focus on hh but then if someone else started another topic they weren't sure any more whether it would makes sense to follow the topics they were working on hh and if there are some specific question like what do you think about this er try to think in this direction on your topic hh it would maybe be helpful to to

EDwsd464:131	S1:	 in the structure in the scaffolding yeah 
EDwsd464:132	S7:	 so so information and and and responsibility didn't remain in in the top actually the top had have pretty much not not a lot to do except for supervising but it is was delegated down to the fora and hh and also like erm on the first day already we would split up everybody in in forums and created the chairs as a recognizable face for a group of twenty people which works very nice also if you have to to go into the town and er ye- er erm s- and still keep the delegates together erm replace them from a to b hh so to say 
EDwsd464:133	S4:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:134	SX-f:	 @@@
EDwsd464:135	S7:	 and er i think the general what i what i heard about on this forum and of course what what i is my experience from [place4] i hear a lot of people say that they find that the [place4] er er the [place4] er conference was less less stressful er than this year so er they f- they feel a lot more pressure this year and i think by by delegating maybe some more er more to the lower levels 
EDwsd464:136	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:137	S7:	 hh not only trusting trusting better the people who are working for the conference in the lowers levels but also trusting more the delegates themselves who come from the universities i think that that would b- be some relief for some people so to say

EDwsd464:293	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:294	S1:	 hh erm all right we will come back er then to your suggestion yes er please 
EDwsd464:295	S13:	 yes hello my name is [S13] [S13/last] and i come from [place6] university i work at something called a research liaison office and er i have been a tutor for [place6] university for since the beginning of all four of the conferences i recognize some of you in the room but not so many erm just generally i would like to say that erm i understand that there's an awful lot of work that goes into these conferences it's really difficult i myself was on the planning committee for an [org8] conference in nineteen ninety-nine and we had seven hundred and fifty participants and its an e- enormous amount of work 
EDwsd464:296	SX-25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:297	S13:	 but just generally the comment that i'd like to make is that it's very i think it's very important that the students get motivated and they get motivated pretty early on 
EDwsd464:298	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd464:299	S13:	 and er one of the one of the factors behind motivating the students is that they understand for example the methodology in in th- in the conference that they understand what they're supposed to do and how it's going to how it's going to go about how it's going to be carried out and i felt that in this er in this case that it was quite unclear for them until quite late in the game and er of course there's that's a factor in getting them going on among other things the online discussion which also was was difficult to get going for them and difficult to motivate them to participate in erm so that's something that's very important and then of course as you mentioned that i think that even xx tutors er are are well aware of quite a er a bit of what is going on the real the really im- important information is how the students perceive the conference 
EDwsd464:300	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:301	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:302	S13:	 and one of the things that i can say initially is i believe that erm that the discussions the meeting with students from all over europe is the core and important part of this conference 
EDwsd464:303	S12:	 hm 
EDwsd464:304	S13:	 and the peripheral activities erm should be dealt by the xx i think that they don't give that much back to the students but they're really interested in in dynamic creative interesting discussions and that we should focus on that

EDwsd464:308	S3:	 and i have to say in the beginning it's very nice to be here among so many people and to see a lot of students all over the world but in the beginning we were confused because of the rules what have to do with the students who should be responsible they were offered ten topics different topics how to choose through the student organization hh and er do communication so the whole communication as a new member or there a lot of information but not sorted as used to be

EDwsd464:367	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd464:368	S16:	 good i think in [place4] and it's it's important to tell the students er very early to how the conference will work the methodology and

EDwsd464:370	S16:	 yah so and i think it's also yeah it's important to to trust them to be a little bit more independent i mean at least the students from vienna are 
EDwsd464:371	S1:	 mhm

EDwsd464:382	S1:	 uhu 
EDwsd464:383	S2:	 my job and i was appointed afterwards er how we prepared er we met two or three times first we discussed how we understand the topics and afterwards we decided that we should write something so i made students to write like five hundred word statements on every topic and th- the problem is that we we don't have anything to we have no option to do something with it xx it would be much better for us that you organizers demand some kind of like written input from us 
EDwsd464:384	S1:	 yah 
EDwsd464:385	S2:	 just to make it useful er and well if speaking about the problems well of course it's great like we admire how much work that it is and stuff like that er but ou- our students complain a bit about that lack of independence and that's the first thing and they complain about a bit about that internet forum hh er in the sense that's erm there was no merit coaching there like

EDwsd464:826	SX-f:	 always 
EDwsd464:827	S1:	 an experienced er student whether graduate or non-graduate it can be somebody from staff that's that's up to the university to decide

EDwsd464:831	S1:	 what they think what they think best

EDwsd464:836	S25:	 th- it it was s- really a mess
EDwsd464:837	S12:	 yeah

EDwsd464:839	S25:	 really 
EDwsd464:840	SX:	 hm 
EDwsd464:841	S12:	 yeah maybe maybe to explain that a bit be- i think first a letter is sent to the rector 
EDwsd464:842	S25:	 yes 
EDwsd464:843	S12:	 er of the university or the president of the university 
EDwsd464:844	S25:	 on jan- on january 
EDwsd464:845	S12:	 asking okay we will be organizing a student conference could you er er nominate or or er send us the name of a person the contact person or the the in charge of the student conference within your university 
EDwsd464:846	S25:	 person in charge of the conference 
EDwsd464:847	S25:	 conference yeah 
EDwsd464:848	S21:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:849	S12:	 and then the organizers receive a name and the the con- there is a contact that is established and so that's the way the preparation starts and probably at some of the universities they change the name they x the contact 
EDwsd464:850	S25:	 yes 
EDwsd464:851	S12:	 and er et cetera 
EDwsd464:852	S1:	 no i think we we we quite appreciate er erm and and there can be no doubt that that we fully appreciate hh er the work and the input erm whatever whatever erm suggestions for improvement have been made are there to 
EDwsd464:853	S25:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:854	S1:	 you know to improve the institution of the [org2] conference and should not be taken erm as a as a criticism on the local organization which 
EDwsd464:855	S25:	 okay okay of course 
EDwsd464:856	S1:	 we know is a huge task er but i think still that that if we want to continue with these student conferences then it is important to have feedback and er 
EDwsd464:857	S25:	 okay okay 
EDwsd464:858	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:859	S25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:860	S1:	 er and to have an open mind on 
EDwsd464:861	S25:	 agree 
EDwsd464:862	S1:	 on things that that might change or that might that we want might to change and so on so tha- that's that's okay and also the hh the tutors' meeting is is a new thing we never done it before but i think it's it's 
EDwsd464:863	S25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:864	S12:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:865	S12:	 useful 
EDwsd464:866	S1:	 it's generates ideas and it it it er hh well contributes towards clarity for the for the next organizers too 
EDwsd464:867	SX-f:	 xx 
EDwsd464:868	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd464:869	SX-25:	 yes 
EDwsd464:870	S12:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:871	S25:	 xx 
EDwsd464:872	S1:	 the the the better they know er the easier it will be to organize 
EDwsd464:873	S25:	 the more @
EDwsd464:874	SX-f:	 yes 
EDwsd464:875	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:876	S25:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:877	S1:	 okay yes 
EDwsd464:878	S13:	 er just a couple of more comments concerning this especially because [place2] is present today what i would like to encourage you to do is that erm to take advantage of the tutors many of us have had experience in the previous conferences but also even for ones that are that are brand new that have never done it before the tutor is many times is always the link to the students we're the ones that are getting the feedback many times from the students and getting a feel for how are they experiencing what's going on at this conference now in in th- in the weeks before it's actually taking place 
EDwsd464:879	S16:	 hm 
EDwsd464:880	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:881	S13:	 and so i would encourage [place2] to when you when you're organizing this to have a certain amount of flexibility just a little flexibility in there that when you get feedback from from a tutor that has a suggestion or recommendation for for example some of the things that came up at this meeting they could have been adjusted during the course of the preparation for the conference but there were no adjustments made that you have that flexibility so that you can take the input and make th- this this small changes that they will make it smoother and easier 
EDwsd464:882	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:883	S13:	 tha- that's just a recommendation from my side you take advantage of the knowledge and the context that we have working as tutors
EDwsd464:884	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:885	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:886	S13:	 the other thing is that i'm getting quite a bit of feedback from my students already and i would like to suggest to the to the organizers for the conference that erm er that they loosen the grip on the students a little bit here it's all too tight 
EDwsd464:887	SX-4:	 get xxx 
EDwsd464:888	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd464:889	S13:	 now the students are beginning to react and say that we can't even 
EDwsd464:890	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:891	S16:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:892	S13:	 we can't even walk away for two minutes to to go the bathroom without somebody telling us we can't go anywhere we can't go anywhere these are most of these students are twenty-five years old twenty-three years old 
EDwsd464:893	S16:	 hm 
EDwsd464:894	S25:	
EDwsd464:895	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:896	S1:	 hh 
EDwsd464:897	S13:	 they're adults if they wanna walk to the proceedings in the morning let them walk don't tell them that they have to take the tourxx or th- or the metro they have to be there at that time it's it's it's getting out of hand you you gotta loosen the grip on these people and let them enjoy the confe- xx 
EDwsd464:898	S25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:899	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:900	S25:	 yes i'm sorry but they are adults 
EDwsd464:901	S1:	 hm 
EDwsd464:902	S25:	 and i don't understand why they are not get up at the at the time you know hh er er er i don't understand the- they th- they say they said to me hh yes i'm not a kid but they were not on time i don't understand you know 
EDwsd464:903	S6:	 xxxxx 
EDwsd464:904	S13:	 hm 
EDwsd464:905	S13:	 i think the thing you do is to let 
EDwsd464:906	S25:	 and the other student were waiting for them 
EDwsd464:907	S13:	 yah 
EDwsd464:908	S13:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:909	S25:	 yeah it's the reason why 
EDwsd464:910	S13:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:911	S13:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:912	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:913	S25:	 you understand that 
EDwsd464:914	S13:	 yeah in this case i don't think 
EDwsd464:915	S25:	 we we can we can beginning the fora er without er all the students you know you have to to to be er a little bit 
EDwsd464:916	SX-2:	 xx 
EDwsd464:917	S13:	 yah 
EDwsd464:918	S25:	 strict i er i i i i 
EDwsd464:919	S13:	 i underst- i understand the need for for organization and so on but i think that 
EDwsd464:920	S25:	 i 
EDwsd464:921	S25:	 i agree 
EDwsd464:922	S13:	 you've gotta find a balance in that because if you go too far the students are gonna go away with a with a negative impression of the of the participation in the conference
EDwsd464:923	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:924	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd464:925	SX-5:	 yes 
EDwsd464:926	S13:	 so some- somehow you have to find a balance i hope you can do that i just want to mention that now because the conference is only one day old 
EDwsd464:927	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:928	S1:	 hm 
EDwsd464:929	S13:	 and there's still time to sort of to to to relax that a little bit but 
EDwsd464:930	SX-25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:931	SX-25:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:932	S13:	 a balance there some- somewhere you y- i'm sure you can find it i hope you can
EDwsd464:933	S2:	 but 
EDwsd464:934	S25:	 okay i'll try a balance 
EDwsd464:935	S2:	 i think maybe some solution is n- not to make them going well coming here together just meeting here at at the university right 
EDwsd464:936	SX-f:	 right 
EDwsd464:937	SX-m:	 mhm 
EDwsd464:938	S25:	 maybe for for yeah
