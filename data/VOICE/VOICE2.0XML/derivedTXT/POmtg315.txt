POmtg315:2	S2:	 @@
POmtg315:3	S2:	 er tha- that was a joint activity 
POmtg315:4	S1:	 a joint activity 
POmtg315:5	S2:	 joint programs we have got joint degrees 
POmtg315:6	S1:	 oh yes you're quite right 
POmtg315:7	SS:	 @@@@@@@@
POmtg315:8	S1:	 s- so we have live we have to live up to what we proclaim right nice okay and i think it would be would make er more sense er that er maybe you presented what you have achieved and how you wish to go on and what you will be wanting to feed into the meeting -morrow if if it is already 
POmtg315:9	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:10	S1:	 there er and then maybe i could react er er i could react to that would that be
POmtg315:11	S4:	 mhm

POmtg315:13	S2:	 yes x xx x 
POmtg315:14	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:15	S1:	 okay
POmtg315:16	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:17	S2:	 er so we've started today's meeting with er some presentations a very short contribution to er what we wanted to be the framework of the final output 
POmtg315:18	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:19	S2:	 and the final output er is er drafting er a procedure 
POmtg315:20	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:21	S2:	 towards joint [org1] european masters 
POmtg315:22	S1:	 excellent excellent yah

POmtg315:26	S1:	 with all the difficulties 
POmtg315:27	SS:	 @@@
POmtg315:28	S2:	 with all the difficulties yes we we've been struggling with the material 
POmtg315:29	S1:	 yes but 
POmtg315:30	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:31	S2:	 let's say er [S5] has been so kind as to tell us inspire us with a creative benchmarking approach to project management erm and then er we have looked at different list of issues or questions that result from [org2] golden rules and er [first name1] [last name1]'s er approach to [org1] european masters 
POmtg315:32	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:33	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:34	S2:	 and then some other er recommendations that have been gathered erm during our first congress we made the first congress before the meeting erm this is the the thing that we have arrived at we decided that eventually there should be a manual of good practice 
POmtg315:35	SX:	 @
POmtg315:36	S2:	 [ORG1] good practice [org1] manual and those who follow it those who follow it when xx approved by the steering committee and the president himself 
POmtg315:37	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:38	S2:	 will be awarded [org1] label for the 
POmtg315:39	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:40	S2:	 joint degree but the manual is a difficult thing 
POmtg315:41	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:42	S2:	 because it should cover very many issues of both academic and administrative erm organizational 
POmtg315:43	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:44	S1:	
POmtg315:45	S1:	 and financial 
POmtg315:46	S2:	 yeah this would be put into 
POmtg315:47	S1:	 th- this would be into the organizational yeah 
POmtg315:48	S2:	 er this yes into or- organizational financial aspect is is er dealt with in some of the points of x 
POmtg315:49	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:50	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:51	S2:	 flip charts on on on the wall anyway the the manual should start with the general er description of the er undertaking some kind of er ideology that is what is [org1] er er what is [org1] european master's degree
POmtg315:52	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:53	S2:	 what are the benefits what are the criteria what are the advantages of setting up such projects 
POmtg315:54	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:55	S2:	 as compared to any other or- ordinary project of this sort 
POmtg315:56	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:57	S2:	 erm then we should er look at the matters to be discussed this this structure has been this er has been erm is believed to be a better one the the vision of the three parts than 
POmtg315:58	SX-4:	 x x 
POmtg315:59	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:60	S2:	 too many covering specific points so first about the general things the second matters to be discussed before setting er a joint program 
POmtg315:61	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:62	S2:	 and the third er processes 
POmtg315:63	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:64	S2:	 which er 
POmtg315:65	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:66	S2:	 should be realized while dealing with these matters covered in the second point and thirdly we would continue that with some other things that we have not 
POmtg315:67	S1:	 mhm yah 
POmtg315:68	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:69	S2:	 thought er very very precisely about but mainly three things form the skeleton of the manual 
POmtg315:70	S1:	 mhm yah yah but this is yah 
POmtg315:71	SX-m:	 uhu 
POmtg315:72	S1:	 uhu 
POmtg315:73	S2:	 are you satisfied with my report
POmtg315:74	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:75	SX-4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:76	SX-4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:77	SX-f:	 @@@
POmtg315:78	S2:	 would you like to add something to it so now we are at a stage of listing or relisting say 
POmtg315:79	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:80	S2:	 picking up bits and bitses from different 
POmtg315:81	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:82	S2:	 charts and filling the rubric entitle ata- academic matters and er filling the rubric 
POmtg315:83	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:84	S2:	 entitle ata- administrative and organizational 
POmtg315:85	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:86	S1:	 wi- with with all the experiences that that individual organizations institutions bring in 
POmtg315:87	S2:	 bring in 
POmtg315:88	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg315:89	S2:	 that's right 
POmtg315:90	S1:	 plus the [org2] perspective plus er [first name1] [last name1]'s paper and so on 
POmtg315:91	S2:	 xx everything xxxx 
POmtg315:92	S1:	 mhm and also i think that erm in order for this manual or this manual will have to be complemented probably by some things that er [org1] will have to supply like er in the in the probably in the administrative parts er you have various legal matters er that is er admission free admission or selection or whatever 
POmtg315:93	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:94	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:95	S1:	 and i think that we that as a if i may suggest er one of the results that we could we could within the network 
POmtg315:96	SX-f:	 yes 
POmtg315:97	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:98	S1:	 try to get a kind of er let me call it a spreadsheet with er er com- with a kind of comparative representation of what the situation is in particular legislations
POmtg315:99	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:100	S1:	 erm like or for example tuition fees are they set by public law or can they be set by the university or are there no tuition fees at all maybe in some countries because this is necessary in order to know erm within the consortium for example where to admit students 
POmtg315:101	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:102	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:103	S1:	 this this is one of the i mean i'm i'm working with a group of er people who academics as it were who want to set up joint degrees also within [org1] and we are trying to look at three different types of problems legal problems erm administrative organizational problems because if you want to run these joint degrees it means you have to rebuild to rebuild your administration in some areas otherwise it would be very difficult 
POmtg315:104	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:105	S1:	 and we have the area the whole area of admission policies er where there are legal boundaries for different er institutions and we have the financial aspects er where we will have to where it might be interesting to devise general guidelines for drawing up financial plans erm and then of course the process that that you have there where one of the one of if i may from my own experience say that one of the problems in the process is at which point in time in the process do you need institutional commitment 
POmtg315:106	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:107	S1:	 so which type of letter by the rector is needed at which point it's a bit like like if you if you erm if you try to get er a commission project you have a letter of intent and and then you'll make things more precise and so on so so this is i think 
POmtg315:108	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg315:109	S1:	 one of the points
POmtg315:110	S2:	 mhm initially it was covered under documentation that is all kind of er 
POmtg315:111	S1:	 aha 
POmtg315:112	S2:	 of 
POmtg315:113	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:114	S2:	 contracts agreements er 
POmtg315:115	S1:	 mhm yah 
POmtg315:116	S2:	 forms et cetera et cetera but 
POmtg315:117	S1:	 d- 
POmtg315:118	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:119	S2:	 this would be the yes somewhere 
POmtg315:120	S1:	 but it might be it it could be it could be er maybe we and then and now xx of course you have it under point number eight 
POmtg315:121	SX:	
POmtg315:122	S1:	 it's quality assurance 
POmtg315:123	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:124	S1:	 this is an important point especially if we want to cap er e u money for curriculum development or marie curie or whatever 
POmtg315:125	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:126	S1:	 er then we have to know where what our quality assurance systems are 
POmtg315:127	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:128	S1:	 and whether they are compatible 
POmtg315:129	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:130	S1:	 erm and also whether they conform to general er quality er quality management standards which er 
POmtg315:131	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:132	S1:	 would be in place x and then you have a point i think here that that also is very is very clever that is mobility erm how to organize mobility and under which frameworks er one point that i if i may say so find missing in the mobility er part er is the e-education component er that is we move students we move teachers but how could we also move content it has to do with with electronic er learning platforms and and things like that er the use of the the use of the internet in the aca- in the process of teaching and learning 
POmtg315:133	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:134	S1:	 more and more universities are developing e-learning strategies 
POmtg315:135	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:136	S1:	 and i think we should we should sort of take that into account that maybe in some areas 
POmtg315:137	SX:	
POmtg315:138	S1:	 there are e-learning possibilities in place that could be very fruitfully er used 
POmtg315:139	SX:	
POmtg315:140	S1:	 erm in the process so that if one partner institution could offer maybe er an appropriate platform the others could sort of be attached to this platform in one way or another 
POmtg315:141	SX-2:	 aha 
POmtg315:142	S1:	 and that would also that would also erm allow to build virtual classrooms in addition to real international classrooms we will need both so i'm not i'm not advocating a completely virtual cooperation but erm we may not always be able to move teachers and students because this is very costly er so we might want to look at possibilities of how it would be 
POmtg315:143	SX:	
POmtg315:144	S1:	 how could we have content 
POmtg315:145	SX-f:	 x 
POmtg315:146	S5:	 and that's a very good point and i think at least what we've seen is that many times these types of projects they start thinking about erm intensive courses summer courses 
POmtg315:147	SX-4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:148	S5:	 erm shorter programs where they join all these students so that seems to be 
POmtg315:149	SX:	
POmtg315:150	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:151	S5:	 immediately one of the idea they have in mind 
POmtg315:152	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:153	SX:	
POmtg315:154	S1:	 aha xxx erm you have probably also already thought of erm er dates like registration dates and when does the term start at which university and and how does that 
POmtg315:155	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:156	S1:	 how does that er go together 
POmtg315:157	S4:	 hh hh i think as i view it now if er because if we compare this structure with what has just been mentioned i think there is basically erm two er different er aspects one is that we c- can come up with something like a guideline that issues that have to be thought of that have to be considered and the process of actually then er implementing them as we said and on the other hand i er would er think that it makes would make sense if we if er this er task force really came up with er so to speak tasks that are then kind of communicated to the individual institutions erm as for example er a er short paper describing the legal situation at the university er which then would then take consideration of the individual er institutions and in the individual situations as we 
POmtg315:158	S1:	 hm 
POmtg315:159	S4:	 er will not be able to clarify this 
POmtg315:160	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:161	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:162	S4:	 within that group 
POmtg315:163	S1:	 exactly what one one example would be who approves of curricula 
POmtg315:164	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:165	S1:	 in some cases it's the university in other cases it's the ministry in yet other cases you have er 
POmtg315:166	S4:	 yes 
POmtg315:167	S2:	 yes 
POmtg315:168	S1:	 external accreditation 
POmtg315:169	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:170	S1:	 and all that has to become transparent so because it 
POmtg315:171	SX:	 yah 
POmtg315:172	S1:	 it then leads to how much time do you need in order to establish a program because it has to go through different stages 
POmtg315:173	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:174	S5:	 that's a very crucial point i think is do they set some sort of time limit or time sort of aspiration that we wish to see [org1] masters because it would be nice to have a big watch 
POmtg315:175	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:176	S1:	 mhm er 
POmtg315:177	S5:	 for the publicity for the marketing for the approvement 
POmtg315:178	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:179	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg315:180	S5:	 and for funding purposes also we can say that this is where we aim at like two thousand and seven or something 
POmtg315:181	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:182	S5:	 this is when there's a big bang 
POmtg315:183	S1:	 er my my if i may if i may have a vision 
POmtg315:184	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:185	S1:	 then my aim would be to have ten european masters in the fall of two thousand and six if if possible if it is eight it is eight if it i- no but you y- you have to have your goals a bit you know er i think it is basically feasible because some projects are already in the pipeline so it's not that we start from scratch 
POmtg315:186	S5:	 that's true 
POmtg315:187	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:188	S1:	 but but i quite agree there should be not a big bang but a small bang at least 
POmtg315:189	S4:	 hm 
POmtg315:190	S1:	 that we can say look this is what we have achieved 
POmtg315:191	SX-5:	
POmtg315:192	S1:	 yeah and and this is this is where we start and then we can and and and then we can proceed 
POmtg315:193	S4:	 would you also please be so kind and maybe repeat the funding erm of er the t- you know two thousand euros that would be 
POmtg315:194	S1:	 yah yah no this is this is something that i will i will 
POmtg315:195	S4:	 funded for the individual proje- proj- 
POmtg315:196	S1:	 we have agreed in the steering committee alongside the the general assembly er that at the moment we have five programs that are sort of in the pipeline er these of which we will hear tomorrow and which we have heard in the past erm [org1] will fund fifteen curriculum development projects with two thousand euro lump sum each er where we will ask one coordinating university to sort of take the money and administer the money er five of of the fifteen five are already there so be- but they need they need some additional money in order to cover meetings for example and there would be ten new er so what what i would like to do er at the beginning of next year as a consequence also of this [org3] coordinators' meeting is launch a call where we will have the criteria that have been agreed upon so the general criteria for master degrees in europe plus the [org1] criteria plus maybe some very general sort of er guidelines from from er this meeting 
POmtg315:197	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:198	S1:	 erm and then we will give we we will give institutions say one or two months in order to er in order to make a proposal 
POmtg315:199	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:200	S1:	 er so that the steering committee er some time in spring could then decide er which additional ten 
POmtg315:201	SX:	
POmtg315:202	S1:	 could we found in two th- we can fund that in two thousand and five 
POmtg315:203	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:204	S1:	 and then i will try to you know i will try if possible to set aside again some money for two thousand and six so that for the next couple of years we have a er we have a certain funding schema er we will then we will then profit from the experience er of of fro- from the experience of any development all the others will then profit and i think the money is wisely invested in the long run and it makes i think more sense to support more er more projects with less money than just one or two projects with er much money 
POmtg315:205	SX-f:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:206	S1:	 because you w- we need a certain spread within the network would you agree that that this makes sense
POmtg315:207	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:208	S2:	 would you agree
POmtg315:209	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:210	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:211	S2:	 yes yes 
POmtg315:212	S6:	 what would be the purpose xxxxx xxxxxxx 
POmtg315:213	S1:	 i i would not i i i would suppose that the activities will probably mostly be 
POmtg315:214	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:215	S1:	 er meetings for the preparation it might also be that maybe you need part of the money to have somebody help you write er an er a proposal for curriculum development and er er erasmus 
POmtg315:216	SS:	 x x 
POmtg315:217	S1:	 yeah
POmtg315:218	SX-2:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:219	S1:	 er i i would not i would say it's a lump sum of two thousand euro and i would not make too many rules er what this money is to be spent on because there should be f- more freedom and er we are not the commission so so this is what you get and and invest it as wisely as possible 
POmtg315:220	SX:	
POmtg315:221	S5:	 @@@
POmtg315:222	S1:	 @
POmtg315:223	S6:	 yeah but still more exchange students 
POmtg315:224	S1:	 no no no this is this is for development this is development party 
POmtg315:225	SX-2:	 xxxx 
POmtg315:226	S6:	 xxxxx x 
POmtg315:227	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:228	S1:	 not for exchange of students but if you want to send one of your staff members to another place to i don't know investigate something or or have er discussions or prepare parts of the curriculum then it might 
POmtg315:229	S6:	 x 
POmtg315:230	S1:	 be used 
POmtg315:231	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:232	S1:	 so we will we will work out the guidelines and then publicize it and then write to all the er er write to all the universities yes please 
POmtg315:233	S5:	 maybe another thing for the for the process part is is for us to suggest exactly this this sort of sources of funding i mean we've been talking about at night i regret that this is of course you know in all of our minds and particularly when we go to the departments that's what they're going to ask you where is the rest of the money coming from we don't have any 
POmtg315:234	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:235	S5:	 time even to teach and blah blah blah that's the the regular mantra but to try and sort of help them in that process i think that's one of the one of the process part of our work how to find further funding because as an example er i mentioned earlier here we are we have a finnish-russian cross-border university initiative and each of the pilots and this is only between finland and russia so there are close by so there's it's quite cheap to meet i think it was about sixty thousand euros per erm year first year and then it goes off er for the coming three years so it's 
POmtg315:236	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:237	S5:	 it's er quite a lot of money that they need if they want to do really from the scratch 
POmtg315:238	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg315:239	S5:	 if it's not from the scratch then it's different 
POmtg315:240	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:241	S5:	 then it's absolutely different but but this is one of our tasks i think to to sort of initiate and 
POmtg315:242	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:243	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:244	S5:	 and sort of er tell them how to find very good funding 
POmtg315:245	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:246	S2:	 this sh- should serve like a seed money 
POmtg315:247	S5:	 yeah 
POmtg315:248	S2:	 cos only there is something it's easier to get more 
POmtg315:249	S1:	 yah 
POmtg315:250	S5:	 yeah 
POmtg315:251	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg315:252	SX-f:	 yes 
POmtg315:253	S2:	 than 
POmtg315:254	S1:	 if you're having if you have something to start with and 
POmtg315:255	S2:	 yes 
POmtg315:256	S1:	 and and again we would have in different countries there are different 
POmtg315:257	S5:	 yes 
POmtg315:258	S1:	 funding possibilities 
POmtg315:259	SX-2:	 hm 
POmtg315:260	S1:	 and in the consortium we we also have to to find out 
POmtg315:261	SX:	
POmtg315:262	S1:	 where the chances are in which country like in [place1] for example unfortunately there are no possibilities of getting money from the state i have no action i know whatever so we can only try to get money from the commission 
POmtg315:263	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:264	S1:	 but not not nati- i don't know what is the case in in [place2] 
POmtg315:265	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:266	S6:	 i will tell you i tell you tomorrow x 
POmtg315:267	S1:	 yah okay yah 
POmtg315:268	S6:	 but it still can be made a little bit at the time xxx this money the seed money was beginning and then these x is er xxxx consortia will apply around all these er good practice er requirement for for getting the [org1] label or xxx 
POmtg315:269	S1:	 yah but but yah but the er erm the [org1] label doesn't give you money 
POmtg315:270	S2:	 ideally 
POmtg315:271	S6:	 ideally yeah 
POmtg315:272	S6:	 yeah of course xxxxxx 
POmtg315:273	S1:	 yah i- i- it's it's it's a kind of quality stamp 
POmtg315:274	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:275	S6:	 yah 
POmtg315:276	S1:	 that might help in raising money from other sources 
POmtg315:277	SS:	 yes 
POmtg315:278	S1:	 yah because we would be able to communicate that we have very strict quality lines

POmtg315:774	S2:	 yes er i think that er 
POmtg315:775	S3:	 er erm 
POmtg315:776	S2:	 now we can we can split into two groups 
POmtg315:777	S3:	 bec- 
POmtg315:778	S3:	 hm 
POmtg315:779	S2:	 one dealing with the academic issues and the other dealing with administrative and organizational issues and somehow all those problems that are listed in order of priority or i- as er or the order er chronological order perhaps 
POmtg315:780	S3:	 hm 
POmtg315:781	S2:	 as they have to be tackled with the er development of the projects 
POmtg315:782	SX-8:	 hm 
POmtg315:783	S2:	 first things first and then what comes next what results from it so what i xxx 
POmtg315:784	S3:	 i heard before as i told [S12] that er you need to have a different level er of thi- er of this kind of manual one for the website er general information and so on because i suppose that er we don't succeed er really in er one hour or two hours to describe so well all these things so it it is the first draft so er from er 
POmtg315:785	SX-f:	 yes 
POmtg315:786	S2:	 xx x yes yes 
POmtg315:787	SX-f:	 yes 
POmtg315:788	S3:	 okay 
POmtg315:789	S2:	 right 
POmtg315:790	S3:	 allora we start er i you suppose and er you expect i am erm under academic 
POmtg315:791	S4:	 yah maybe we should 
POmtg315:792	S3:	 group 
POmtg315:793	S3:	 hm 
POmtg315:794	S4:	 also for our research people here @@@
POmtg315:795	S3:	 xxxxxx 
POmtg315:796	S4:	 maybe erm er arrange the tables so that we have two two working groups and 
POmtg315:797	S2:	 working groups 
POmtg315:798	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:799	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:800	S2:	 into x 
POmtg315:801	S3:	 we can er use that table there without er move 
POmtg315:802	S4:	 yeah of course 
POmtg315:803	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:804	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:805	SX-m:	
POmtg315:806	S5:	 xxx

POmtg315:808	SX:	
POmtg315:809	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg315:810	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:811	S3:	 goodbye we are separated 
POmtg315:812	SX-f:	 @@@
POmtg315:813	S2:	 so 
POmtg315:814	SX-f:	 xx 
POmtg315:815	S4:	 so 
POmtg315:816	S2:	 how should we split there's a the academic or the administrative this is the academic x administrative the academic even number of people in each group and i think that it would be co- good if somebody xxx more academic than administrative join the administrative group and one administrative person join the academic group so that's it 
POmtg315:817	SX-6:	 yah 
POmtg315:818	S2:	 a balance is kept between ideals and er pros of life 
POmtg315:819	S10:	 xx academic no 
POmtg315:820	SX-m:	 x 
POmtg315:821	SX-f:	 xxx x 
POmtg315:822	S5:	 i'm still concerned about the process 
POmtg315:823	S4:	 aha 
POmtg315:824	S2:	 the process
POmtg315:825	SX-f:	 process 
POmtg315:826	S5:	 what are we g- what are we going to do about you know section three 
POmtg315:827	S4:	 yeah isn't that what we should dea- er isn't that something that we should deal now 
POmtg315:828	SX-5:	 mhm 
POmtg315:829	S4:	 with i mean is that so- isn't that shouldn't we now really focus on the process and on er on on on on questions that come up er when we deal with these issues
POmtg315:830	S5:	 i don't know the thing is that we this is a list that the people that then get together will 
POmtg315:831	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:832	S5:	 deal with and now the process should be okay how do you start dealing with that 
POmtg315:833	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:834	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:835	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg315:836	S5:	 so this is this is the idea behind process part this in mind 
POmtg315:837	S4:	 and i think this this should be the questions that we should now deal with in the working groups primarily 
POmtg315:838	S5:	 but if you do it for example if if the groups are doing for example prioritization then it's not that it's not it's not it's not the process part that i'm thinking of the process part is saying okay here's how you find funding further funding for your for your development process here's where you find information on the internet about how to build er joint degrees these publications might help you er these are the 
POmtg315:839	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:840	S5:	 these this is a way for example 
POmtg315:841	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:842	S5:	 benchmarking where you need to you know based on trust and blah blah blah 
POmtg315:843	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:844	S5:	 er these are the issues that you might want to look at 
POmtg315:845	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:846	S5:	 erm these types of things er i think should be in the process 
POmtg315:847	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:848	S9:	 s- s- adding concrete substance 
POmtg315:849	S5:	 yes 
POmtg315:850	S9:	 you mean by saying process or just 
POmtg315:851	S5:	 well for the pr- for the process meaning that this is how you start doing this negotiati- negotiation on the list of things 
POmtg315:852	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg315:853	S9:	
POmtg315:854	S9:	 yah 
POmtg315:855	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:856	S5:	 but i think er erm the idea for these working groups was not i mean it doesn't add up to the process part if we start for example prioritizing this 
POmtg315:857	S9:	 i don't think we should prioritize this at all 
POmtg315:858	S4:	 me neither 
POmtg315:859	S5:	 this is how i understood xxx 
POmtg315:860	S9:	 er perhaps put it into chronol- chronology 
POmtg315:861	S5:	 yeah but still you know even that doesn't you know if we make a chronological list we do the list and that's it 
POmtg315:862	S4:	 hh hm 
POmtg315:863	S5:	 but for the manual we don't say we put it into a chronological list just take it we say okay this is what you can start doing er these are the these are the ways in which you start negotiating these things 
POmtg315:864	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg315:865	S5:	 okay so i don't i maybe i'm not making myself understood but i just what i what are what are your ideas of putting into the process parts 
POmtg315:866	S4:	 well i i er er er at least i think i got your point as regards process 
POmtg315:867	S5:	 yeah 
POmtg315:868	S4:	 er and i think that this should be the main focus now it shouldn't be the main focus to er list the these aspects according to a certain structure neither to chro- xx chronological order nor to the way to the order according to which you have to consider these things while developing a joint degree but really address as many er issues as possible with er which help us er in the process of implementing or developing a joint degree 
POmtg315:869	S3:	 [S5] we have to avoid er to to be too much progress 
POmtg315:870	SX-f:	 hh hhh 
POmtg315:871	S3:	 to implement too much progress so i- in some aspect i think that er each project er means to have a kind of flexibility 
POmtg315:872	S5:	 sure 
POmtg315:873	SX-2:	 hm 
POmtg315:874	S3:	 er so i think that er 
POmtg315:875	S5:	 absolutely 
POmtg315:876	S3:	 er perhaps er what er you are suggesting is the most difficult things to do but er er er the process you are saying as needs to have er really clear the ideas underx xx the process so i think er that 
POmtg315:877	S5:	 i think the process here 
POmtg315:878	S3:	 we can try er to enter a little bit they know the xx that er we have a written there and that perhaps the the second part of the process is er directly deriving er no from the first xx i think that er we can start in some way [S5] 
POmtg315:879	S5:	 well i just think that this this you know the whole idea of the project ta- task force was also to think of of how to help these 
POmtg315:880	SX-8:	 yeah 
POmtg315:881	S2:	 hm 
POmtg315:882	S3:	 yes yes obviously er x 
POmtg315:883	S2:	 yes xxxxxxx 
POmtg315:884	S3:	 bu- er 
POmtg315:885	S5:	 and it's not only just listing these things but it's also say 
POmtg315:886	S2:	 no 
POmtg315:887	S3:	 no no 
POmtg315:888	SX-f:	 xxxxx 
POmtg315:889	S5:	 okay this is how you can start doing things here is it where you can find funding er for 
POmtg315:890	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:891	SX-8:	 yah 
POmtg315:892	S5:	 the actual development part 
POmtg315:893	SX-3:	 yes yes 
POmtg315:894	S4:	 yes 
POmtg315:895	S5:	 so 
POmtg315:896	S2:	 you're right but er still i think we have to start with a list 
POmtg315:897	S3:	 but er er 
POmtg315:898	S3:	 er 
POmtg315:899	S3:	 er xxxxxxx 
POmtg315:900	S4:	 yeah and that's what we have already done 
POmtg315:901	S2:	 but it's it's do you think that's er it should not be done in a chronological order or priority order 
POmtg315:902	S4:	 well if it takes if it takes up too much time now with thinking how we can possibly arrange it according to a chronological order i think that's a waste of well er i think we can reorder and restructure it later on 
POmtg315:903	S2:	 okay 
POmtg315:904	S2:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:905	S4:	 er er i think what we really have to address now is erm as you just said how can we help which information do we need to provide 
POmtg315:906	S5:	 hm 
POmtg315:907	S4:	 which questions and that's what i think [S1] [S1/last] meant with er questions erm that which questions should be answered by individual institutions and settings 
POmtg315:908	S2:	 all right 
POmtg315:909	SX:	 xx 
POmtg315:910	SS:	 yes 
POmtg315:911	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:912	S4:	 that's basically two two two aspects ho- what what information do we need 
POmtg315:913	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:914	S4:	 and er secondly what information er er can we not provide or are we we are not able to provide so far er which have to be er er provided by the individual institutions as legal situations at er what [S8] mentioned about the terms when do they start and so on and so forth so we can also really come up with a catalogue of questions er that will then be should then be ans- answered within let's say the next couple of months by the individual [org1] institutions 
POmtg315:915	S2:	 okay so in such a si- situation having done the list in in that order as it stands 
POmtg315:916	S6:	
POmtg315:917	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg315:918	S2:	 w- we'll have to proceed to immediately to the questions 
POmtg315:919	S4:	 yah 
POmtg315:920	SX-f:	 mhm true 
POmtg315:921	S3:	 first question how to start the process for establishing a joint master because er we are we have xxx on these er thinking that er we know that other people like in europe is so good to join er me in doing er something er er how a professor of vienna or from helsinki or oslo is able to reach other people wishing to do the same course european course possibly er er i- the process er [S5] the process 
POmtg315:922	S5:	 yes exactly 
POmtg315:923	S5:	 yes 
POmtg315:924	S2:	 mhm so we 
POmtg315:925	S3:	 there is a list no x this is not possible

POmtg315:945	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:946	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:947	S5:	 but those 
POmtg315:948	S6:	 hm 
POmtg315:949	SS:	 x 
POmtg315:950	S5:	 and it's important that those are the most important things but how to get them there 
POmtg315:951	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:952	S5:	 to that same table is is another matter 
POmtg315:953	S2:	 so i think we should split anyway 
POmtg315:954	SS:	 @@@@@@@@@@@@
POmtg315:955	S2:	 and erm well on the questions that are to be asked and to be answered when setting up a project and er as i have suggested earlier the academic group and the administrative issues group will be dealing with er issues that are listed there but in the aspect of 
POmtg315:956	SX-6:	
POmtg315:957	S2:	 those questions that we er we need to have answers to them 
POmtg315:958	S4:	 or the information we wanna provide and which er er questions do we need 
POmtg315:959	S2:	 would you like to write it down the the the the the two questions er how x two two two approaches that we need to adopt now 
POmtg315:960	S4:	 i understood you correctly here 
POmtg315:961	S2:	 yes as [S5] 
POmtg315:962	SX-9:	 mhm 
POmtg315:963	S4:	 i think it's the the various the very the very overarching aspect is 
POmtg315:964	S2:	 xxx 
POmtg315:965	S4:	 to provide information i've a manual should provide information and people should er take this manual and they should find answers to questions and we can come up with the information they need however in this er group ca- we are not able to answer all the questions but we need to develop and and er kind of er formulate questions that will within the next couple of months be answered within the initial [org1] institutions so er 
POmtg315:966	SX-5:	 xx 
POmtg315:967	S4:	 resulting from the information we're gonna provide questions er with the answers by the [org1] institutions 
POmtg315:968	S5:	 but i think in the process part i think there in the master's programs blah blah blah good practice number four and number five that should be included exactly the question you know how do you start up er er of making a joint program 
POmtg315:969	S3:	 hm 
POmtg315:970	S5:	 which persons to involve er er what was the other one er not th- not number five particularly number four is relevant for that 
POmtg315:971	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:972	S5:	 who to involve because otherwise you might just end up i mean academics not the students not the administrators not the relevant people from the relevant offices 
POmtg315:973	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg315:974	S11:	 x the first question is why do you need joint program 
POmtg315:975	S2:	 hm 
POmtg315:976	S11:	 why do you need this joint program it is first question why do you need this joint program it is the first question 
POmtg315:977	S2:	 hm 
POmtg315:978	S11:	 xxxxxx xxxxxxxx 
POmtg315:979	S6:	 xxx but actually know how you are setting up program and that this is er er er very much connected with all other xxx groups xx xxx 
POmtg315:980	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:981	S6:	 so these objectives they are left line left side first line somehow xx 
POmtg315:982	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:983	S6:	 this is the initial xx why you need 
POmtg315:984	S4:	 hm 
POmtg315:985	S6:	 to establish such programs 
POmtg315:986	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg315:987	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg315:988	SX:	 xxxxxxxxxx xx 
POmtg315:989	S4:	 that is 
POmtg315:990	S6:	 no the xx the xxx the idea then the contact and then 
POmtg315:991	SX-5:	 x x x x x x xxx 
POmtg315:992	S4:	 this should be discussed 
POmtg315:993	S6:	 some academic people thin abou- think about that xxx and then they contact their administrators 
POmtg315:994	S4:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg315:995	S6:	 this is xxx 
POmtg315:996	S2:	 process yes 
POmtg315:997	S6:	 xx xx xxx

POmtg315:1000	S6:	 xxxxxx 
POmtg315:1001	SX-5:	 xx 
POmtg315:1002	S6:	 and then the the joint er xxxxxx usually er xxx between academics and between xx how they follow each other 
POmtg315:1003	S3:	 there are also some er aspect that er we have no time to speak xx now er in general that [org1] master's program what aim er in general it is mainly directed to european countries and er these imply to have an european structure or european interest x if you can say all must be mainly attractive er for people coming er 
POmtg315:1004	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:1005	S3:	 from other countries not european countries 
POmtg315:1006	S11:	 that's 
POmtg315:1007	S11:	 xxx 
POmtg315:1008	SX-2:	 hm 
POmtg315:1009	S3:	 er because i think that at this point we have to 
POmtg315:1010	S2:	 yes xxxx criteria xx set up for [org1] 
POmtg315:1011	S3:	 say clearly also this fact perhaps maybe good only to european only for european or to be attractive for other people because other people are looking at er europe for what reason because er we have a long tradition in our university because we have some excellence er in some field of the science er and so on so er i think that this may be important if the project complies with some general er criteria 
POmtg315:1012	S2:	 well if we look at the criteria that have been er set up by the criteria group of the xxxxx then perhaps this could give us some inspiration on how to develop our er proceedings er that we mentioned in projects do you do you all have the this is this is the criteria 
POmtg315:1013	SS:	 xxxx 
POmtg315:1014	S4:	 the 
POmtg315:1015	S4:	 yeah they are they are they are very much er restricted now er in xx i think you still got a long version 
POmtg315:1016	SS:	 xxxxx 
POmtg315:1017	S2:	 but this is 
POmtg315:1018	S4:	 er

POmtg315:1031	S3:	 xx 
POmtg315:1032	SX-3:	 xxxxxx 
POmtg315:1033	S4:	 erm in general as far as i've understood er we should be very careful erm th- that er there are not too many overlaps with the criteria task force betw- because what this is actually called 
POmtg315:1034	S3:	 this one 
POmtg315:1035	S4:	 is really er project management so it it it really it it should we should not 
POmtg315:1036	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg315:1037	S4:	 er deal so intensively with questions as like you know why do we need joint degrees and so on i think this is part of the introduction that can also be er that co- also came out al- already partly out of the criteria task force as wha- wha- what er what [S6] has just said so i think we should really er deal with the pragmatic organizational management er aspects 
POmtg315:1038	S6:	 i think that's true but at the at the beginning er among these criteria there are some choices or some preferences what kind of program sh- should comply xxx xx 
POmtg315:1039	S2:	 okay but whatever the problems were there must be some management of the program and and we are arranged to to we should be focusing on the process of management rather than on selection of topics and selection of xxx et cetera i suppose because thi- this is the the matter of the criteria group and whatever the criteria are there must be some some structure in our work 
POmtg315:1040	SX-f:	
POmtg315:1041	S10:	 maybe x xxxxxx

POmtg315:1046	S2:	 right 
POmtg315:1047	S2:	 yes

POmtg315:1058	SX:	 mhm 
POmtg315:1059	S8:	 well that's that's not where we are that i somehow we have to start as if that problem is solved there is a group of academics wanting to work together with academics at other universities and then 
POmtg315:1060	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg315:1061	S8:	 when they find each other which they haven't er to some extent
