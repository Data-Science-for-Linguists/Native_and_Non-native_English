PBmtg27:122	S5:	 with [first name7] xx and you know that more or less cos would be interested to know if they are also committed in the import side which will balance the rates you know 
PBmtg27:123	S1:	 hh er i don't know i really don't know yeah but er as we all think with the high dollar course 
PBmtg27:124	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:125	S1:	 we have a chance yeah cos one twenty-seven one twenty-eight which is today one thirty erm should be hh reasonable i will make now two calculations one twenty-five and one thirty as exchange rate hh and see what where we where we d- do we need to end hh the three positions if you go for the flight with with er the full payload not the reduced one for seventy-eight x erm bear in mind the flyaway kit is not on board this is already tonnagewise er not so much but positionwise so eight tons payload less we have a payload of sixty-five we will have a price which we had for fifty-two tons or fifty-three tons 
PBmtg27:126	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg27:127	S1:	 actual 
PBmtg27:128	S5:	 well i wait and see i don't know i i don't think that er those guys from [org6] will just calculate the same rate you know 
PBmtg27:129	S1:	 yeah yeah [first name3] offered already to me 
PBmtg27:130	S5:	 the rate of fifty-four 
PBmtg27:131	S1:	 if she can take three positions from [org6] line her idea is to give us the twenty-five thousand dollars less meaning back to the seventy-eight x deal 
PBmtg27:132	S5:	 fifty-four yeah yeah 
PBmtg27:133	S1:	 and i said to her yeah then we are near to it [first name2] and my target will be around a reduction of thirty to thirty-five thousand dollars and then three positions less no f a k on board full payload to seventy-eight gross again but some have eight tons so it will be seventy sixty-nine sixty-eight gross for us plus volumewise it's only three position points cos their cargo is high-dense from line 
PBmtg27:134	S5:	 yeah but but the thing is that er their cargo is gonna be the the a m g containers which is taking you the three position one of three three nice positions on the aircraft so no
PBmtg27:135	S1:	 hh but for three positions for each position ten thousand dollars er ooph 
PBmtg27:136	S5:	 our pivots is going out two two you know so i mean you just have the calculation with a french or with the swiss or with the italians 
PBmtg27:137	S1:	 yeah two two by er we have no rate which is er er er higher than one euro eighty or one euro ninety so make life easy even if you would get two two euro 
PBmtg27:138	S5:	 but er i mean yeah the thing is 
PBmtg27:139	S1:	 a kilo it's four thousand euro we have on a position or let's say five thousand euro which equals six thousand dollars hh and we will get ten thousand dollars hh but even this would be not our problem cos we will not get a kickback or something 
PBmtg27:140	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:141	S1:	 simply we will get a new charter contract as from april with a certain amount which integrates three positions are not our positions
PBmtg27:142	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:143	S1:	 so also life life easy okay
PBmtg27:144	S5:	 yeah

PBmtg27:154	S1:	 good [S3] especially the weekend problems 
PBmtg27:155	S3:	 hhh nothing special went so far for the amount of cargo it went well i mean i i had one discussion with [first name8] erm regarding an a d b drive shipment for beijing which they actually it wasn't at any time available for the m er for the m u flight but instead of calling somebody or er asking either [first name13] or myself what to do with it they just kept it on f- er in luxembourg and documents had been found at three or one o'clock sunday so we easily would have catched the c a flight monday usual problems but that was it actually
PBmtg27:156	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg27:157	S3:	 for that amount it picked little bit up we had more freight on last weekends normal

PBmtg27:220	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:221	S4:	 and for the u k business we're still on a good position i reduced the rate a little bit 
PBmtg27:222	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:223	S4:	 but the yield would still be quite interesting if we keep it the the volume of cargo is decreasing something like thirty per cent less than last year cos they're back on schedule and they send most of the cargo with er with vessels 
PBmtg27:224	S1:	 ˈɪʃn don't like it 
PBmtg27:225	S4:	 yeah apart from that 
PBmtg27:226	S1:	 let's do something let's go to to u k and to manchester and ruin their factory 
PBmtg27:227	S4:	 voila 
PBmtg27:228	S1:	 voila erm the organigram from er [first name15] 
PBmtg27:229	S4:	 mhm
PBmtg27:230	S1:	 i have seen

PBmtg27:234	S1:	 aha 
PBmtg27:235	S4:	 he refused

PBmtg27:237	S4:	 more or less yeah 
PBmtg27:238	S1:	 okay hh i see what this means again 
PBmtg27:239	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:240	S1:	 erm did you hear from from from from [first name17] something about this [org10] story 
PBmtg27:241	S4:	 no i er spoke on friday evening with [first name18] they would offer three kinds of er services from sydney 
PBmtg27:242	S1:	 be very careful we just quoted a complete new [org10] xx 
PBmtg27:243	S4:	 i know he got it as well and he realized that er the rate i gave him was er different than the one i received from er [first name19] and i told him consider the one we gave you cos i think there was only one and er one eighty-five
PBmtg27:244	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:245	S1:	 one rate from [first name19] and he 
PBmtg27:246	S4:	 only one rate he got not from [first name19] directly but from the the g a d from paris to the guy i er xx say this cos 
PBmtg27:247	S1:	 yeah i stopped er stopped with [first name18] as well for taipei to issue he was asking them there he drive everybody crazy crazy in this er matter for for [org10] 
PBmtg27:248	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:249	S1:	 so er also for the rest if er [first name18] [last name18] cames to you with [org10] rates you refuse to talk to him
PBmtg27:250	S5:	 @
PBmtg27:251	S1:	 yeah you give it to us er [S7] and myself and er the best greetings er will be go to [first name20] in basel cos we are annoyed of quoting left right and center 
PBmtg27:252	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:253	S1:	 yeah every two weeks something er [first name20] is getting er nuts as well yeah because if they don't erm if er [org11] is not able to manage this account correctly then it's a [org11] problem
PBmtg27:254	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:255	S1:	 and bear in mind the rates er must be valid for a long long time two years i think or three years they want to fix rates 
PBmtg27:256	S4:	 yeah the 
PBmtg27:257	S4:	 the thing i learn as well is that they can offer a service on a direct carrier so means we could er add a a service on M p 
PBmtg27:258	S1:	 mhm
PBmtg27:259	S4:	 so a and b service would be under [org12] 
PBmtg27:260	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:261	S4:	 for example 
PBmtg27:262	S1:	 but i'm not pretty sure er [S7] do you having in the mind the transit time they want to have for australia three days on a direct flight
PBmtg27:263	S7:	 to [org10] 
PBmtg27:264	S1:	 wasn't pretty sure yeah we can look it up

PBmtg27:641	S3:	 okay

PBmtg27:643	S1:	 and this we have er that's

PBmtg27:652	S5:	 have we ever proposed to transfer the unit into xx
PBmtg27:653	S1:	 hh they do it in the meantime they take with the unit after arrival security officer put it in [org11] video camera has break down every piece is okay delivered thefts so it's it's in lug- it's it's in lugano we all know hh but the er question is er the only explanation i still have is somebody at the factory knows that in this boxes for hong kong where the good things are from [org17]

PBmtg27:1105	S7:	 how long you are in the company now
PBmtg27:1106	S1:	 you don't want to know 
PBmtg27:1107	S7:	 i i really don't know 
PBmtg27:1108	S5:	 this year it will be twelve years here 
PBmtg27:1109	S7:	 wow 
PBmtg27:1110	S5:	 but it's not the matter i mean if i felt for me i obl- dou- double my my salary when i entered twelve years ago is normal if i enter today i will have a let's say twenty per cent more salary than when i started in ninety-two which is normal 
PBmtg27:1111	S7:	 yeah yeah sure 
PBmtg27:1112	S5:	 the people which are coming now 
PBmtg27:1113	S7:	
PBmtg27:1114	S5:	 do could it be erm i don't get that and i don't get this difference between here and first floor or second floor pf i don't know
PBmtg27:1115	S1:	 and this is exactly what i meant about people now working at [org11] where i say i don't want to take these kind of expert clerks cos this is not what we need hh i have no problem to pay 
PBmtg27:1116	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1117	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1118	S1:	 people as you know i'm the the last one but you know that the decision is not by myself 
PBmtg27:1119	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1120	S1:	 i can steer it a little bit in future but you know the decisions are in basel not from my desk but this way the younger generation it sounds silly and that we're all around about thirty here a little bit higher they just want to have first the money before they do anything and this is a problem that's what what i turned to express also with with the example [first name8] i mean [first name8] has some 
PBmtg27:1121	S5:	 yeah i think 
PBmtg27:1122	S1:	 don't want to g- say something bad against [first name10] but he has very some good sides but this is exactly this picture he gives i mean you know he is different than the way he he er he looks er to the other colleagues or other colleagues see him hh and this is what 
PBmtg27:1123	S5:	 it's not only you i mean in germany is very simple i mean you explain to somebody 
PBmtg27:1124	S1:	 we don't need 
PBmtg27:1125	S5:	 that he has to get a forty-five per cent taxing from your salary in germany and he is coming to luxembourg it's only thirty-two 
PBmtg27:1126	S1:	 [first name43] 
PBmtg27:1127	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg27:1128	S5:	 tha- that's right i i i can't believe that you don't find someone single in germany that is interesting you know
PBmtg27:1129	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg27:1130	S1:	 hhh 
PBmtg27:1131	S5:	 although that you said yesterday people are frightened about that as well so that's a kind of a
PBmtg27:1132	S1:	 nobody knows what 
PBmtg27:1133	S3:	 i guess in germany is another problem still you have in germany quite another problem that's why normally when it's announced in the intranet normally the ep- er from the situation you have now with [org11] and [org15] there should come er c vs in 
PBmtg27:1134	S1:	 they're not coming since one year it's also clear erm i spoke yesterday to [first name50] to have [first name51] and said yes i would have somebody i could send to you and i would but sorry this would ruin my team cos everything else i have is also crap and those people who are quite good they will not ask they will make everything comfortable they will go to the [last name52]s to the [last name53]s and say 
PBmtg27:1135	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg27:1136	S1:	 er what is this job ah don't go and they are losing and er er the management already it start
PBmtg27:1137	S3:	 that's typical 
PBmtg27:1138	S1:	 that's er a lot of things 
PBmtg27:1139	S3:	 the problem is that that it starts of the management level cos they don't tell their people what's going on
PBmtg27:1140	S1:	 ooph the problem is [S3] and this is the only i fully agree to you one hundred per cent but i'm fu- you know my sentence as well it's more than time that even our management is taking decisions i mean since two years we do this we reorganize we will this their work is changing yeah i mean i we are all annoyed 
PBmtg27:1141	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1142	S1:	 we are all fed up i don't wanna say the other word i recognized lately that even people what i think or thought they are still good motivated are fed up
PBmtg27:1143	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg27:1144	S1:	 yeah erm i try to be er optimistic as as much as i can be i have a perspective yo- you know but er pf i'm fed up myself what what shall i hire now what shall i hire 
PBmtg27:1145	S5:	 well just another a projection on your career 
PBmtg27:1146	S1:	 [S5] best erm to all of you what shall i hire now i have one corner for how is the job in one year booking reservation call center let's name it the worst scenario in shifts hm 
PBmtg27:1147	S5:	 then they will just look for the person in in the department 
PBmtg27:1148	S1:	 and then i have the other edge and then i have the other edge
PBmtg27:1149	S5:	 yeah
PBmtg27:1150	S1:	 overruling rights about all everything lane management trade lane management for your lanes 
PBmtg27:1151	S5:	 yeah good idea i know 
PBmtg27:1152	S1:	 so in between there today's sales is somewhere in between this yeah but in between these both corners we will end in one year what kind of people shall i hire now 
PBmtg27:1153	S7:	 hm 
PBmtg27:1154	S1:	 i'm raising this question [S7] knows this er when i get a frustrated er thing hh i can hire people from the warehouse cos i can train them easily within two weeks for booking reservation
PBmtg27:1155	S5:	 yeah but then it 
PBmtg27:1156	S1:	 and watching a screen and doing this
PBmtg27:1157	S5:	 no
PBmtg27:1158	S1:	 and they will be happy about it and i have to pay one thousand five hundred euros less than to the normal salary you have today or i hire somebody with a real experience comes here yeah would be good if you go one way after one year er i can fire him her whatever if it's booking reservation we need the decisions from basel and not only from our own xx we need it to be very honest from our top management since two years there is nothing since two years hh we do nothing since two years we are sitting and hm what shall we do and not not only we as our department i mean the complete company
PBmtg27:1159	S5:	 yah 
PBmtg27:1160	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg27:1161	S5:	 no in this case i will concentrate on somebody for the operations i mean which er knows already traffics if he start now to be er only booking reservation afterwards then i still he already told me one step i mean we can be a xxx 
PBmtg27:1162	S1:	 yeah but if if you need somebody who knows the commercial market who has market knowledge who knows to do his carriers 
PBmtg27:1163	S5:	 but this to learn you know i mean 
PBmtg27:1164	S1:	 hh the other side is easier to learn hhh 
PBmtg27:1165	S5:	 yeah of course @
PBmtg27:1166	S1:	 i had yesterday discussion for example with [S4] 
PBmtg27:1167	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1168	S1:	 and he is vice versa he says commercial 
PBmtg27:1169	S5:	 hm what
PBmtg27:1170	S4:	 it's easier to learn operations or 
PBmtg27:1171	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1172	S4:	 the operations you have 
PBmtg27:1173	S1:	 mhm
PBmtg27:1174	S4:	 to to know on a daily basis 
PBmtg27:1175	S1:	 hhh 
PBmtg27:1176	S5:	 er i don't agree 
PBmtg27:1177	S4:	 it's more difficult to get a knowledge of the market er on which you have to be concentrated or on which you have to concentrate 
PBmtg27:1178	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1179	S5:	 of course 
PBmtg27:1180	S5:	 but this guy which is coming i mean er he's gonna start like you and me i mean first you was er doing operation of course i was doing operation and afterwards well you was in contact with people and you get their feedback you got to [S1] i give you here the feedback so
PBmtg27:1181	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1182	S5:	 till the moment you didn't know
PBmtg27:1183	S4:	 but the other way around it's i think easier
PBmtg27:1184	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1185	S4:	 if you have the knowledge of the operation but big knowledge of the the airfreight in the commercial part 
PBmtg27:1186	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1187	S4:	 it's easier to learn within two three months easily the operation things 
PBmtg27:1188	S5:	 ah yeah for sure i mean er 
PBmtg27:1189	S1:	 also 
PBmtg27:1190	S1:	 don't forget 
PBmtg27:1191	S4:	 i think so
PBmtg27:1192	S1:	 don't forget one point if somebody's coming from the outside if it's [org11] outside or whatever 
PBmtg27:1193	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg27:1194	S1:	 it's fresh air in the brain we all are in tracks 
PBmtg27:1195	S5:	 yeah of course this is on the i mean you just have to to think one thing also is that till now you have given chances to operation people on the department now you want two people from the outside so people inside get frustrated 
PBmtg27:1196	S4:	 mhm
PBmtg27:1197	S5:	 and maybe when they work the same way they were working before or just stop in production the productivity or whatever 
PBmtg27:1198	S4:	 expecting something 
PBmtg27:1199	S1:	 yeah okay but erm one way or the other i mean there's no decisions yet er taken but erm one way or the other 
PBmtg27:1200	S5:	 general for sure i mean er i i think also that it is gonna be okay to have somebody from this area to have some other ideas 
PBmtg27:1201	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1202	S1:	 a good mixture 
PBmtg27:1203	S5:	 i know er maybe even somebody from the competition maybe you know ooph 
PBmtg27:1204	S1:	 er normally a good mixture is better 
PBmtg27:1205	S1:	 exactly erm somebody er especially if you think about er cooperation with frankfurt 
PBmtg27:1206	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg27:1207	S1:	 but a lot of cargo will not come to luxembourg so the value of knowing luxembourg as a very special 
PBmtg27:1208	S5:	 somebody from frankfurt 
PBmtg27:1209	S1:	 operational x
PBmtg27:1210	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg27:1211	S1:	 they know everything here perfectly yeah no doubt about it but this is not the way it works in frankfurt this is not the way it works in a normal airfreight 
PBmtg27:1212	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1213	S1:	 yeah this is a total special way and if we consider that a lot of cargo will not move via luxembourg any more yeah erm s- strength like [S4] has for example developed in in time virtuality yeah er and those are for more value
PBmtg27:1214	S5:	 we trade and x x x 
PBmtg27:1215	S1:	 i have no problem i'm no- don- don't get it wrong [S5] i have no problem to train somebody 
PBmtg27:1216	S5:	 @
PBmtg27:1217	S5:	 no no i'm always 
PBmtg27:1218	S5:	 funny but this virtuality because the virtuality he has with [org3] was part it but [first name54] is going to amsterdam directly and now he has a image i wonder 
PBmtg27:1219	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1220	S5:	 which for the time being is not big issue so i don't know what you want to try to develop afterwards you gonna be increasive by a hundred per cent or two hundred per cent but er hh it's very it's very funny the more virtuality on the project of the air border and so on you know because what you you said before from your trade lane manager to the booking reservation xxx 
PBmtg27:1221	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1222	S1:	 some- somewhere in between that's that's is still the problem otherwise we could start m- much easier and much much faster hh 
PBmtg27:1223	S5:	 so the 
PBmtg27:1224	S5:	 yeah it's kind of xx 
PBmtg27:1225	S1:	 we're running behind that's why since since months you see no development from my side as well i stopped it cos i don't know where we're heading to i see erm most likely the way 
PBmtg27:1226	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg27:1227	S1:	 but as long as not confirmed from basel i will not start things
PBmtg27:1228	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg27:1229	S1:	 yeah i will rather concentrate on the things we have today and then to continue the things and then develop those 
PBmtg27:1230	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg27:1231	S1:	 but who will start already with frankfurt very soon paris will be profit center next month most likely and then paris will change completely 
PBmtg27:1232	S5:	 i know
