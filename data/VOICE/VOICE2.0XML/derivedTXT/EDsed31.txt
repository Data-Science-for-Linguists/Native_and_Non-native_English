EDsed31:835	SX-f:	 yah 
EDsed31:836	S1:	 but we have to look a- look at it as if a culture and the behavior of people in a culture would be something like a normal distribution hh and you'd have i don't know he- here you'd have one one aspect of a culture hh and you would have i don't know a ma- a majority of people behaving in a certain way but you'd have other people who don't behave in this way so if this is austria and we take i don't know let's take time orientation towards time and we say we have i don't know a meeting at twelve o'clock then a majority of austrians would be there at twelve o'clock hh more or less hh but it also means there'll be some austrians who would arrive at at quarter to twelve and there'll be some austrians who'd arrive at maybe half past twelve hh er and you'd have all different kinds of individuals so the standard distribution is made up of of individual people hh who have individual hh ways of doing things but the tendency is the people would arrive on time meaning at twelve o'clock sharp hh erm and so whenever you talk about cultural differences you have to k- keep in mind that you deal with one person not the austrian hh and this one person might behave in a very different way from from the rest of the austrians so this is important hh and also the aspect of time will only be m- mentioned or will only be experienced differently by people who come from cultures hh who have a very different concept of time hh if austrians and germans are compared in terms of time hh there won't be m- very very big differences because both cultures are known to be relatively punctual may- maybe germans even more so than austrians but in hh i- in reality you wouldn't find big differences so hh f- austrians and germans would not bring up the concept of time as something that's very different between the two cultures hh if you talk to people from hh
