POmtg314:179	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg314:180	S5:	 and i have here to support my it i won't take too long i think there might be a lot of questions and and ideas that sort of at least i've noticed that this is this er actually giving a lot of ideas to my work when i'm dealing with er our departments and i have to say that this actually came up first when er we started cooperation under the umbrella of er finnish-russian cross-border university which is an initiative by those finnish several finnish universities it's five finnish universities the ministry of education and the ministry of foreign affairs actually the ministry of foreign affairs er funds this project and we have five finnish universities four russian universities and believe it or not our aim is to have er by two thousand and seven fall two thousand and seven er finnish-russian er mast- joint masters programs so that is you can imagine all the implications that that has because russia is not within the e u er their educational system as the whole society is still under reform hh erm all sorts of in- interesting issues but we're very much striving for that i can tell you a little bit about that later but but first of all some ideas about education cooperation developing long-term cooperation between several institutions and across borders takes time this i've noticed is very difficult to s- to really er tell the departments that are very eager to start cooperation immediately you probably noticed those of you who have worked with departments hh er where in in joint degrees that they want to start next fall they want to start next semester and what i'm trying to say is look we need at least er let's say one two maybe three years to plan this there are so many issues hh and the next thing is they say well but we have these courses in english or we have these courses that we prepared my our partners have their courses we just put them together and and i'm i feel that many times i am pulling the brakes and i'm really and i'm consciously doing it because i know that time is needed we know from several other projects be it erasmus intensive programs or curriculum developing projects or [org4] projects that time is needed for proper er educational operational work curriculum convergence as er goes deep into the structures 
POmtg314:181	S3:	
POmtg314:182	S5:	 methods and underlying values of teaching hh so it is not only individual courses er with individual er course contents but it it's full programs it's about how we teach how students study how students perceive their role as as students and part of the process how teachers themselves what are the er what are the structures in each of the part- participating university faculty er to support er teaching and learning what are the rules and regulations it's not only national er rules and regulations it's also local for example i think in all of our universities we have university level er er rules and regulations but then there are departmental or faculty or both levels also intact
POmtg314:183	S5:	 so these are things that many times people don't think about when they start er developing joint degrees and joint programs hh and as i said the teams collaborate er they collaborate particularly across borders they organize meetings erm and i'll show what kind of time frame usually is suggested or sort of what kinds of steps hh so first of all of course we need to build the benchmarking teams erm then you need to negotiate and decide on the content of benchmarking because it could be different you know in our case that would be ob- obviously to create joint programs okay in some other cases it could be something else but in our case it would be joint programs now clarifying the matrices there are examples of the matrices and what they can contain er the university of [place11] has them modified and and they have very good examples hh but i think er what they are saying i understood is that for each particular project the matrices need to be decided on er jointly by all of those who are participating so it's not the standard thing but basically there are already er models that can be used and then modified so it's not something that we need to start from the from the scratch then there's a lot of wo- work xx in in erm i think in working on matrices these are not easy questions in the matrices and the the people at [place11] have have said that it is first of all it is crucial that the teams really spend time on working on the matrices but at the same time they complain that there's so much work involved and that they might not see what the point is not at the beginning when they start answering these very difficult questions hh and if you don't answer the questions honestly and with time the whole basis for this type of cooperation or this type or using the tool is gone so there needs to be a lot of coaching a lot of sort of erm being there and assuring that really this is necessary and and it's good for you there are they proposed the people at [place11] have developed this tool and have actually tried it out x they proposed two workshops minimum one to initiate the cooperation so you have the first version of the matrices and then you come together with both student teams and the coordinating teams and then you compare and make a comparison er or maybe even a a joint matrix may- mah- matrix from these all and then the second one is when you really know already quite a lot about each other and you really aim at cooperation because this basic level of knowledge has been established er through the matrices and through the f- first workshop so this is this is in a very very short er presentation what er is intended by creative benchmarking there is publication at a website that i i mentioned the website and there is there is publication that i can pass around erm i noticed that when i in in our er finnish-russian cross-border university when this was presented er benchmarking there popped up immediately afterwards in the er in in the small groups of academics that are really the ones who are then er then er creating the joint programs
POmtg314:184	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg314:185	S5:	 so they really started thinking about it when it was presented to them in a very thorough manner much more thoroughly than i'm doing here because we don't have too much time but i'm thinking if we ever get a chance to get those departments or representatives of those departments that then are somehow selected or evolved from our processes that they will stop doing er joint degrees joint programs if we get them together er we could probably at least show them that there is a tool that they can use but this needs to be done right at the start because if we don't do it right at the start they will you know momentum is lost

POmtg314:265	S7:	
POmtg314:266	S1:	 will eventually be ensure that scientif- sufficient academic ad- administrative staff resources are involved in the program hh it's not only the the the the the personnel hh er or the the the human work but er the funding is also absolutely essential if you don't have the funding you have to at least be er sure how much money you are short of to have enough er hh well time to to look for the money and to look for possible funding sources hh erm take er that information of the programs easily accessible to students that's that's absolutely vital the transparency and the openness is is is important easy access and obvious access to hh information organize and plan sufficient meetings in advance so it's not only planning meetings but planning everything as erm drawing and varying particulars of the land hh

POmtg314:318	S5:	 what i think is we we seem to know quite well what kinds of things need to be looked at i think what we need to know or we x w- we need to sort of establish is how do we make sure that the hopefully the future projects will do it that they will look at these things both formally and then in practice how do we make it possible within [org2] and this this these two things both formal ways of ensuring that they are done but that that's not enough i think the more difficult part is to to really get to really help er departments that start developing these [org2] programs hh how do we help them in in establishing and working on these issues 
POmtg314:319	S1:	 mhm well you cannot erm pass a decree on it in obviously and the only usable practical thing is to make people owners of certain processes and procedures so well judging from my teaching perspective 
POmtg314:320	S8:	 hm

POmtg314:322	S5:	 mhm hm mhm 
POmtg314:323	S1:	 so once we become owners of this procedure we ourselves become er convinced that these are practical er practical and and applicable then we could sell on sell them on but not rubbing them in but just inspiring them and eventually formulating something along the lines that that we had or will have adopted or would have adopted
POmtg314:324	SX-4:	 yah 
POmtg314:325	S5:	 because we do have xxx at the university of [place4] i can pass them on also erm rules er regulating erm joint degree developments so there are rules and we have to sort of remind them xxx we have to have an agreement for example and these are the procedures how things are done within our institution hh so this is the sort of ultimate check

POmtg314:437	S1:	 good efforts i'm having problems well er to put it in a perhaps not a perfect way but the question as such as such is signalized in the xx preamble we would er hh erm

POmtg314:450	S6:	 yes 
POmtg314:451	S1:	 [org2] label idea
POmtg314:452	S5:	 er what exactly is is is do we understand under [org2] label at the moment is that hh because there is the task force criteria hh who's worked out er worked basically on the criteria 
POmtg314:453	SX-7:	 hm 
POmtg314:454	S5:	 that a [org2] joint master program should er hh er er should erm come up to basically the six criteria is the the task force worked on the criteria hh and now we've reduced them reduced there was a kind of hh er came up with a summary er of six criteria that er were er also agreed on by the general first of all by the steering committee and then by the general assembly hh if that is something that we are talking about here i'm not sure whether this is what er 
POmtg314:455	S1:	 xxx yeah 
POmtg314:456	S5:	 i would agree that that's exactly what constitutes [org2] label hh and i think this is actually a very crucial point because we might have let's say ten er ten developments going on 
POmtg314:457	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:458	S5:	 they will be in you know all over europe they will be quite far away from each other we cannot 
POmtg314:459	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:460	S5:	 keep too much of contact with each other hh but they need to realize this they need to be able to first of all identify themselves each of these ten or whatever amount will be er from this preamble 
POmtg314:461	S3:	
POmtg314:462	S1:	 mhm
POmtg314:463	S5:	 why would they be within with- within this i already notice in our little cross-border university project 
POmtg314:464	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:465	S5:	 that it seems to be constantly we need to remind them that you are not just one thing there are there are six projects within that six developments for joint degrees
POmtg314:466	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:467	S5:	 we constantly need to remind them that okay there is something of course for your project but this is a joint thing also between the six and they need to sort of you know from the beginning realize this because there's a lot potential for something good together

POmtg314:469	S8:	 hm 
POmtg314:470	S1:	 mhm

POmtg314:724	S1:	 er 
POmtg314:725	S5:	 mhm

POmtg314:727	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg314:728	S5:	 yeah

POmtg314:730	S6:	 mhm 
POmtg314:731	S5:	 yeah 
POmtg314:732	S1:	 when we go deep into the existing system and try to establish a common platform 
POmtg314:733	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg314:734	S5:	 this manual of good practice so may- maybe we can suggest that this sort of work is done right at the beginning this sort of you know comparison 
POmtg314:735	S1:	 yes 
POmtg314:736	S1:	 uhu 
POmtg314:737	S5:	 and truthful discussion
POmtg314:738	S1:	 so 
POmtg314:739	S1:	 this should be 
POmtg314:740	S2:	 yeah if 
POmtg314:741	S4:	 somewhere in documentation perhaps 
POmtg314:742	S8:	 s- s- sorry

POmtg314:744	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg314:745	SX-2:	 yah yah 
POmtg314:746	S5:	 yeah 
POmtg314:747	S8:	 sorry [S1] perhaps er the points are so many that we have distinguish the hh academic matters er administration er er matters so for example hh these erm 
POmtg314:748	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:749	S5:	 true yeah xx 
POmtg314:750	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:751	S8:	 erm point er of [S4] is very important because er not all er are starting in the same time is making some problem hh but it's a kind of internal structure of the program

POmtg314:754	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:755	S4:	 yah 
POmtg314:756	S8:	 so er is it not academic er problem 
POmtg314:757	S2:	 yeah maybe 
POmtg314:758	S8:	 we we have to try to divide 
POmtg314:759	S2:	 yeah maybe we can put the structure on it afterwards so that we 
POmtg314:760	S8:	 different bec- because xx in quality assurance and the diploma supplement for example these are hh some er 
POmtg314:761	S1:	 mhm
POmtg314:762	S8:	 er not really strategical point bec- but er how er they are weighed no hh 
POmtg314:763	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg314:764	S1:	 mhm so now we are brainstorming
POmtg314:765	S8:	 so in documentation perhaps documentation 
POmtg314:766	S2:	 yeah i would su- suggest also maybe er what er [S5] has had mentioned about the time 
POmtg314:767	S8:	 maybe [S5]- er [S5] 
POmtg314:768	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:769	S2:	 maybe we can mention also in the introduction er the kind of the timeline of the procedure of 
POmtg314:770	S5:	 xxx

POmtg314:772	S2:	 i mean it very much depends on the individual sit- er institutions and on the individual groups 
POmtg314:773	S1:	 hm 
POmtg314:774	S2:	 but that that maybe can be can be er mentioned in the introduction hh and then we can have two main chapters something like er er er content or that regards er academics and administrative features so that we have two main chapters and then

POmtg314:779	S5:	 good idea

POmtg314:782	S8:	 xx yes er is maybe 
POmtg314:783	S5:	 i think it would be better to have the sort of you know academic initiative

POmtg314:910	S2:	 well i think that's also a er a question that er that we have to answer but in general hh there should be something like [org2] hh manual possible or a guideline that people can refer to that the individual can er institutions can refer to hh when er they er if they want to develop a joint degree hh together so it's basically a paper that er hh er [org2] members should be able to ta- take advantage of hh er i doubt whether this is something that should be published or that should be kind of hh er be be helpful for for other er institutions or other networks as well i th- i really think that this is something hh er that can be regarded as a privilege that then [org2] membersh- er institutions would have in their hands hh er to kind of make the development of joint degrees easier

POmtg314:940	S2:	 yah 
POmtg314:941	S12:	 but then may i ask perhaps i missed x xx xx xx xx do we have any kind of the basic xxtion textual basic information what does it mean to launch [org2] joint program up to now in in my case i just er poorly explained to some people around 
POmtg314:942	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:943	S12:	 what could be expected and so on and so forth but the basic information x xx audience in which we give some very general lines what er what are xx what is the strategy xxxxx what are the erm possibilities what are the potential sources xxxxx i think er 
POmtg314:944	S5:	
POmtg314:945	S12:	 is necessary will be i i do not say that we have to formulate it before that but we should think in terms of having it 
POmtg314:946	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:947	S12:	 because otherwise probably it will i mean it's quite difficult to go through perhaps technically to the text than you than you xxx or that without having to fund of course they pay this er the general plans rectors of the [org2] universities decided that and that rector then means you should apply or you should make a consortium you should xx with the support of so on so forth
POmtg314:948	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:949	S12:	 but this information and what is xxation what are the what are the peoples which distinguish this xx network in the respect to others 
POmtg314:950	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:951	S12:	 that information i always have to repeat again and again 
POmtg314:952	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:953	S12:	 that sometimes xx somehow sometimes xxx because they do not have any xx
POmtg314:954	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:955	S12:	 and i hoped i i expected this [org5] should make the steps xx so this two working groups 
POmtg314:956	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg314:957	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:958	S12:	 they xxx these considerations we should extract some kind of short congress and very xxxx 
POmtg314:959	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:960	S12:	 i think i think 
POmtg314:961	S2:	 mhm mhm i should i also think er the more we talk about it the more hh er it comes to my mind that we should really have an area hh on the on the [org5] home page hh er on the website that is er very much or only exclusively dedicated to the development of joint degrees where you find practical information where you find hh agreements between rectors hh where you really have er which should not probably i mean that is always the question hh 
POmtg314:962	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg314:963	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:964	S12:	 yeah 
POmtg314:965	S2:	 erm of er whether it should be in the closed area in our forum or whether this should really be something that is erm er accessible to to to anyone hh i think this er it that's very much a question of documentation and information what you are also referring to [S12] that something hh that it has to become transparent 
POmtg314:966	S12:	 right 
POmtg314:967	S2:	 so that er it's not always the same people it's not always us providing individuals with the information and passing on hh the information hh er in a very also it's also a bit tiring and also a bit demotivating and it's it's it's it's a kind hh of er prevents us from from going further and er 
POmtg314:968	S12:	 xx this is just our problem because i think some people could maybe contact xx 
POmtg314:969	S2:	 of course 
POmtg314:970	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg314:971	S4:	 mhm 
POmtg314:972	S12:	 other universities and nobody asking what xx xx do 
POmtg314:973	S4:	 yah 
POmtg314:974	S12:	 and then i told them okay i'm going now to [place1] and we will xx something and sort of do a report but then it is time to give the others back 
POmtg314:975	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:976	S12:	 to define 
POmtg314:977	S2:	 hh and there is of course i mean there is other the the follow-up er hh task force are planned and should be the the results also of er tomorrow's and saturday's meeting hh er that really we er as a group decide which further steps and which er have to be taken and which new task force has have to be founded 
POmtg314:978	S12:	 yah xx 
POmtg314:979	S12:	
POmtg314:980	S2:	 er and i think that this is very much the hh er one s- step into into this direction 
POmtg314:981	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:982	S2:	 so maybe 
POmtg314:983	S1:	 xxxx yes mhm so it's nearly one o'clock shall we discuss it er 
POmtg314:984	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg314:985	S1:	 the results of the pair work at the moment concerning the restructuring or structuring that the the text that will eventually erm come up with xxxxx and so on 
POmtg314:986	S7:	
POmtg314:987	S2:	 erm i mean [first name1] [last name1]- er 
POmtg314:988	S1:	 lunch
POmtg314:989	S2:	 as i told you [first name1] [first name1] [last name1] will will join us after lunch 
POmtg314:990	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:991	S2:	 er i also wanted him to to to work with us for an hour at least or half an hour hh so that he er exactly or that he also points us into the direction where w- he as [org2] president wants us to go hh so maybe we can then briefly sum up what we have discussed so far hh er when when he when he joins us or when he has joined us hh and then er er with him together hh er go a little bit f- into further details or would you i mean i think that the idea of a group work or a group 
POmtg314:992	S1:	 okay 
POmtg314:993	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:994	S2:	 or pair discussion is also a good idea er hh the the only problem is that it er takes up quite an large amount of time
POmtg314:995	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:996	S2:	 good it has to be communicated back to the the group then as well 
POmtg314:997	S1:	 right yes 
POmtg314:998	S10:	 i remember one of the want want to add to marketing also and that er 
POmtg314:999	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg314:1000	S10:	 i think xxxx the languages er so say under the content or or something xxxxx xxx 
POmtg314:1001	S1:	 yes yeah mhm 
POmtg314:1002	S1:	 yah so the problem is education assistance under mobility

POmtg314:1004	S1:	 erm and er 
POmtg314:1005	S10:	 xxx yes

POmtg314:1007	SX-2:	 mhm 
POmtg314:1008	S5:	 one thing comes to my mind if we want if if we continue with this this er sort of good practice manual would it be possible to have three main topics like first of all

POmtg314:1010	S5:	 a sort of general [org2] sort of renowned standards 
POmtg314:1011	S1:	 would you like to put it down on the on the xxx flip chart 
POmtg314:1012	S5:	 erm 
POmtg314:1013	S5:	 so this sort of general part which is being in the preamble of all that so that is that is definitely needed and that is sort of the general x why we are doing this i mean otherwise okay 
POmtg314:1014	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:1015	S5:	 who cares hh and the second one is matters xx agreed on or whatever it's it can be phrased differently but basically the- these are the things that needs to be discussed and agreed on 
POmtg314:1016	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:1017	S5:	 hh and they can be either academic or administrative so we can also divide them if we want to but this 
POmtg314:1018	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:1019	S5:	 needs to be borne in mind so both things need to be 
POmtg314:1020	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg314:1021	S5:	 need to be so first the general part then let's keep it like matters to discuss or to to
