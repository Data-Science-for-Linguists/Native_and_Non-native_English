PBmtg414:433	S3:	 [S2] what what you are seeing here these are our sales to you 
PBmtg414:434	S2:	 i know i know but i'm checking with my system 
PBmtg414:435	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:436	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:437	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:438	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:439	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:440	S2:	 the the thing is what i found out looking at figures 
PBmtg414:441	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg414:442	S2:	 what i found out our in-market sales is is thirty-five per cent above last year 
PBmtg414:443	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:444	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:445	S2:	 and but when i looked at the information i've got from from a buying point of view 
PBmtg414:446	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:447	S2:	 i saw that we were on the same er at the same level as last year but now i'm looking here at these figures and here i see that we're not on the same level so i'm 
PBmtg414:448	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:449	S2:	 now questioning my own er buying er sales figure so there must be something wrong in the system 
PBmtg414:450	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:451	S5:	 mhm so you have 
PBmtg414:452	S2:	 in m- in our system 
PBmtg414:453	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:454	S5:	 you have lower figures than
PBmtg414:455	S2:	 yeah far lower 
PBmtg414:456	S5:	 this 
PBmtg414:457	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg414:458	S2:	 so er i was that's also i w- i was really looking into it and i 
PBmtg414:459	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:460	S2:	 i couldn't find a solution why the difference was so huge 
PBmtg414:461	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:462	S2:	 cos i what i saw is a a growth of thirty-five per cent in market 
PBmtg414:463	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:464	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:465	S2:	 and a buying value exactly the same as last year and i couldn't match that also not looking at stocks because there was not a big difference in stock level
PBmtg414:466	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:467	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:468	S2:	 so i was really thinking hey how is this possible and also when you l- look at this slide @ it's erm it's not in the presentation but 
PBmtg414:469	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:470	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:471	S2:	 when you look at this slide this is the er the absolute sales per period
PBmtg414:472	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:473	S2:	 so that's er that's above last year above last year above last year above last year above last year this one okay that was last year's 
PBmtg414:474	S5:	 they're just pi- pieces 
PBmtg414:475	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:476	S2:	 er [org3] er loading in 
PBmtg414:477	S3:	 delivery mhm 
PBmtg414:478	S2:	 delivery so that was below but again above above 
PBmtg414:479	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:480	S2:	 and when i look then at the
PBmtg414:481	S4:	 buying 
PBmtg414:482	S2:	 the buying er tha- that's that's this and there okay tha- that's cumulative but 
PBmtg414:483	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:484	S2:	 er 
PBmtg414:485	S3:	 the indexes were yeah 
PBmtg414:486	S2:	 you know the the indexes are are 
PBmtg414:487	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:488	S2:	 o- okay sometimes good but sometimes very worse and and 
PBmtg414:489	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:490	S2:	 i couldn- i couldn't match that so but now 
PBmtg414:491	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:492	S2:	 er some some 
PBmtg414:493	S3:	 we are above 
PBmtg414:494	S2:	 something something is wrong in er in in er in our system somewhere you know at least in ou- in my buying figures
PBmtg414:495	S3:	 compared to last year 
PBmtg414:496	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:497	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:498	S3:	 mhm mhm no we increased we increased the the buying volume compared to last year b- 
PBmtg414:499	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:500	S3:	 by about sixty thousand sixty thousand euros was haben wir zweitausendfuenf
PBmtg414:501	S5:	 yeah because two thousand five we had two hundred and seventy thousand
PBmtg414:502	S3:	 yeah right 
PBmtg414:503	S5:	 in total we see 
PBmtg414:504	S2:	 in total year and now we are on two hundred seventy-seven 
PBmtg414:505	S5:	 in total we see it here and and 
PBmtg414:506	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:507	S2:	 so and we still have 
PBmtg414:508	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg414:509	S3:	 right some 
PBmtg414:510	S2:	 four 
PBmtg414:511	S5:	 x and then it's 
PBmtg414:512	S2:	 four months to go 
PBmtg414:513	S5:	 october 
PBmtg414:514	S3:	 some 
PBmtg414:515	S5:	 october order was twenty-six thousand so that that's

PBmtg414:519	S4:	 and without the order of yesterday and so on 
PBmtg414:520	S3:	 we will probably end up 
PBmtg414:521	S5:	 that's without er without yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:522	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:523	S3:	 to meet the plan you know so then you can see the growth 
PBmtg414:524	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:525	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:526	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:527	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:528	S5:	 so we have around three hundred now including october order and then still 
PBmtg414:529	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:530	S2:	 november december 
PBmtg414:531	S5:	 november december so 
PBmtg414:532	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:533	S4:	 yeah

PBmtg414:592	S5:	 so the last column is two thousand six january to 
PBmtg414:593	S4:	 this er table's er two thousand six and this one is er two thousand five yeah

PBmtg414:607	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:608	S4:	 er and erm that are the yeah that are the items which are not er dispenser which can also see that er erm that there is higher sales in er fruit er refill packs and also with the cola blisters erm i hope you can er read it because it's really invisible 
PBmtg414:609	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:610	S5:	 @@@
PBmtg414:611	S4:	 but last year erm we have sold thirteen hundred er fruit refill blisters and this year erm yeah we have sold more than four thousand 
PBmtg414:612	S5:	 four thousand 
PBmtg414:613	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:614	S4:	 but that's also an high increase hh and i think that has to do 
PBmtg414:615	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:616	S4:	 yeah with more distribution and er with er placing in the b- the best place 
PBmtg414:617	S5:	 you had cola as a xxx as well yeah 
PBmtg414:618	S4:	 yeah we have introduced the cola b- er blister or we've sold till this moment er yeah more than er one thousand erm 
PBmtg414:619	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:620	S4:	 that's our s k u 
PBmtg414:621	S5:	 the minis they are more or less erm gone
PBmtg414:622	S4:	 the minis yeah yeah but i think erm 
PBmtg414:623	S5:	 but with the last order you're you ordered er 
PBmtg414:624	S3:	 small quantity 
PBmtg414:625	S5:	 minis 
PBmtg414:626	S4:	 yeah
PBmtg414:627	S5:	 yeah a small quantity 
PBmtg414:628	S4:	 from the stand-up bags
PBmtg414:629	S5:	 from the stand-up bags yes 
PBmtg414:630	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg414:631	S5:	 cos i was i was 
PBmtg414:632	S4:	 er the 
PBmtg414:633	S3:	 surprised 
PBmtg414:634	S5:	 surprised because erm 
PBmtg414:635	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:636	S5:	 during the whole year there was no order 
PBmtg414:637	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:638	S4:	 but i think that hh and 
PBmtg414:639	S2:	 we had a lot of stocks 
PBmtg414:640	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:641	S2:	 still from last year on that product
PBmtg414:642	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:643	S2:	 and you know er when er when we have one customer ordering a product we just order it er it's 
PBmtg414:644	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:645	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:646	S2:	 it's also our bit of service er to costumer so 
PBmtg414:647	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg414:648	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:649	S4:	 i think you have er created a new stand-up blister
PBmtg414:650	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:651	S4:	 er which will replace er w- which will replace er the stand-up bags yeah 
PBmtg414:652	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:653	S3:	 the stand-up yeah 
PBmtg414:654	S5:	 the stand-up bag and then probably xxx 
PBmtg414:655	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:656	S4:	 and i think we will yeah we will follow that because er 
PBmtg414:657	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:658	S4:	 er this look is more uniformity the er uniformity in the shelves of the
PBmtg414:659	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:660	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:661	S4:	 blisters and then yeah we think about er what we will do with the stand-up blister but i think yeah we we can kick it off er can kick out the st- 
PBmtg414:662	S3:	 the stand-up bag you mean 
PBmtg414:663	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:664	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:665	S5:	 the stand-up bag with the minis 
PBmtg414:666	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:667	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:668	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:669	S5:	 i mean 
PBmtg414:670	S3:	 no 
PBmtg414:671	S4:	 because if if you 
PBmtg414:672	S3:	 the stand-up bag should should fade out 
PBmtg414:673	S4:	 mhm okay yeah 
PBmtg414:674	S3:	 more or less
PBmtg414:675	S4:	 yeah because if we have no stand-up bags any more that's irrational 
PBmtg414:676	S3:	 no there is no time pressure behind but 
PBmtg414:677	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:678	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:679	S3:	 erm 
PBmtg414:680	S5:	 because we probably have enough foil but when it's 
PBmtg414:681	S3:	 in a few months they just they just faded yeah 
PBmtg414:682	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:683	S5:	 when it's gone then 
PBmtg414:684	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:685	S5:	 we're also x x x not prepared 
PBmtg414:686	S4:	 and what dates er do you want to er kick up only stand-up bags have you prepare er erm one special er event or xx xx or xxx okay 
PBmtg414:687	S3:	 no we will we will 
PBmtg414:688	S5:	 no we're flexible 
PBmtg414:689	S3:	 right right yeah mhm 
PBmtg414:690	S5:	 in all the countries we can discuss it as as soon you er would like to have them 
PBmtg414:691	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:692	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:693	S5:	 because to 
PBmtg414:694	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg414:695	S5:	 we have to discuss if you er would like to have the same bar code or if you would like have another bar code 
PBmtg414:696	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg414:697	S5:	 depends on your system as well 
PBmtg414:698	S4:	 yeah yeah okay 
PBmtg414:699	S2:	 hm the th- the thirteen per cent increase in in that's only in blisters so that's excluding er the refills
PBmtg414:700	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:701	S2:	 and that's until september
PBmtg414:702	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:703	S2:	 so that's comparable figures september september

PBmtg414:960	S2:	 really falling apart they had three formulas now they they sold out er the [org12] formula they sold out the [org6]- no the [org13] hhh and i think from the whole organization that was two years ago it was more than one thousand stores and i think they will end up with 
PBmtg414:961	S4:	 three hundred and sixty-one 
PBmtg414:962	S2:	 three hundred and sixty 
PBmtg414:963	S4:	 yeah

PBmtg414:972	S3:	 okay and and they will remain 
PBmtg414:973	S2:	 erm nobody knows but there's 
PBmtg414:974	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:975	S2:	 hh i think they they will remain but i they won't n- they will not be powerful enough to succeed 
PBmtg414:976	S3:	 m- 
PBmtg414:977	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:978	S2:	 just with one formula or only with three hundred sixty stores so they will 
PBmtg414:979	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:980	S2:	 actively search for new partnershipping and perhaps where one or two members out of the [org8] er organization 
PBmtg414:981	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:982	S2:	 and er you know the thing is [org8] in holland is a buying organization as she said she she said yourself 
PBmtg414:983	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:984	S2:	 and they have fourteen or fifteen members 
PBmtg414:985	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:986	S2:	 but those members are getting bigger and bigger but 
PBmtg414:987	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:988	S2:	 the also what happens now is that they really come in each others region 
PBmtg414:989	S3:	 mhm
PBmtg414:990	S2:	 in in the older days they had their own region and they were th- more or less they are the the the king of their region 
PBmtg414:991	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:992	S2:	 but now when by by taking over all the the stores from [org11] they enter each others re- they mix up 
PBmtg414:993	S3:	 they mix up 
PBmtg414:994	S3:	 they really mix up mhm 
PBmtg414:995	S2:	 so now they have the same buying er buying erm er prices er 
PBmtg414:996	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:997	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:998	S2:	 so they know exactly 
PBmtg414:999	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1000	S2:	 what their competitor is doing in their region
PBmtg414:1001	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1002	S2:	 so that that will now or t- today or tomorrow will change and er i think one or some some [org8] members will step out 
PBmtg414:1003	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1004	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1005	S2:	 and then perhaps we will find we will get a new cooperation with [org11] yeah nobody knows but that's 
PBmtg414:1006	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1007	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1008	S2:	 something will happen cos 
PBmtg414:1009	S3:	 but some some kind of concentration will 
PBmtg414:1010	S2:	 yeah and and a new buying organization will will be set up i think 
PBmtg414:1011	S3:	 follow 
PBmtg414:1012	S3:	 mhm mhm

PBmtg414:1031	S2:	 and you know imagine yeah whe- when you're on the table you have your negotiations it's also part of er you know you you've have emotions it's it's the m- the moment yeah you're you always try to seek the moment 
PBmtg414:1032	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1033	S2:	 and okay and then you finalize your discussion you have an agreement put it on paper and a week later when they are really then then they sit back look at the agreement become more rational again and say no we ain't gonna do it and they just wipe it off the table and er and they do it constantly
PBmtg414:1034	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1035	S2:	 so it's er they dictate now what happens 
PBmtg414:1036	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1037	S2:	 what what you also see er especially with [org3] hh everyone who now thinks that he can bring in a new brand 
PBmtg414:1038	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1039	S2:	 the first a- question they ask er can we get it at private label 
PBmtg414:1040	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1041	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1042	S2:	 and erm and they when you look at er in the in the when you now look in the confectionery shelf 
PBmtg414:1043	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1044	S2:	 i think forty per cent of all the s k us 
PBmtg414:1045	S3:	 is private label 
PBmtg414:1046	S2:	 is private label and it's er and it's only twenty-four per cent of the total sales 
PBmtg414:1047	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1048	S2:	 so and what you see is it doesn't bring anything 
PBmtg414:1049	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1050	S2:	 th- the market is is is is minus two 
PBmtg414:1051	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1052	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1053	S2:	 so the market is down 
PBmtg414:1054	S2:	 er and it has to do with prices of course private labels are 
PBmtg414:1055	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1056	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1057	S2:	 a little bit cheaper than brands 
PBmtg414:1058	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1059	S2:	 i didn't it doesn't bring anything 
PBmtg414:1060	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1061	S2:	 but yeah they are telling er to the trade hey er this is this is the way the only way to er to differentiate er compared to the er the other er formulas and 
PBmtg414:1062	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1063	S2:	 now well everyone has its private label huh [org6]- [org6] they all they all go into private label 
PBmtg414:1064	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1065	S3:	 the- they all have their own private label range 
PBmtg414:1066	S5:	 their own private 
PBmtg414:1067	S2:	 they all have their private label range 
PBmtg414:1068	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1069	S2:	 so bringing in a new new concept bringing in new brands 
PBmtg414:1070	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1071	S2:	 is 
PBmtg414:1072	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1073	S2:	 is getting more and more difficult 
PBmtg414:1074	S3:	 difficult mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1075	S2:	 again er especially when when you have let's say o- o- one product yeah let's say o- one very strong product 
PBmtg414:1076	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1077	S2:	 we have one of th- one st- very one very strong product that's the [org15] lollipop 
PBmtg414:1078	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1079	S2:	 and er i think the moment we we go to them and say okay we change the design they will automatically say okay change the design and get it into my pri- into private label and we ain't gonna do that because 
PBmtg414:1080	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1081	S2:	 doing that means that you will kill yourself because then they will immediately er 
PBmtg414:1082	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1083	S2:	 screw you and erm 
PBmtg414:1084	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1085	S2:	 but that's that's that's at thi- this moment er the situation everyone i- is i- into private labels 
PBmtg414:1086	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1087	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1088	S2:	 and the brands are really suffering
PBmtg414:1089	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1090	S2:	 really suffering 
PBmtg414:1091	S3:	 mhm and do you also experience that the buyers change very often very regularly
PBmtg414:1092	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1093	S2:	 what you especially see in the sugar confectionery area that the buyers change a lot 
PBmtg414:1094	S3:	 that's also
PBmtg414:1095	S2:	 but also that the sugar confectionery area is now an area where they er er er only only use let's say s- starting buyers so not not really 
PBmtg414:1096	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1097	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1098	S2:	 erm er sophisticated ones with a lot of knowledge 
PBmtg414:1099	S3:	 sophisticated ones 
PBmtg414:1100	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1101	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1102	S2:	 erm and it i think it has everything to do with with the low involvement of of sugar confectionery 
PBmtg414:1103	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1104	S2:	 you know it's erm er when you really tal- when you talk about erm er bread or whatever erm people are always very interested in in in in f- in f- in in f- real food products 
PBmtg414:1105	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1106	S2:	 you know it's there is a real added value in there and sugar confectionery er what can you do wrong huh you know that's a little bit the feeling 
PBmtg414:1107	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1108	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1109	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1110	S3:	 m hm 
PBmtg414:1111	S2:	 so okay just place a er er wh- when you look at [org3] there's this guy he's called [first name6] [last name6] he had no experience whatsoever in sugar confectionery he came out of the the the booth er business 
PBmtg414:1112	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1113	S2:	 and er and he's responsible for twenty-nine per cent of the sugar confectionery market in holland and he doesn't know a thing 
PBmtg414:1114	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1115	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1116	S5:	 @@
PBmtg414:1117	S2:	 it's unbelievable 
PBmtg414:1118	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1119	S2:	 and they just hh but okay y- you know what it is huh with the sugar confectionery when you when place a product you sell it yeah because it's in it's it's still ninety per cent it's impulse 
PBmtg414:1120	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1121	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1122	S2:	 so er there is not a real yeah added value to er to sugar confectionery and that's er 
PBmtg414:1123	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1124	S2:	 and that's that's negative that's a downside of of er of the or that's a negative in- er influence on the market because er 
PBmtg414:1125	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1126	S2:	 yeah selling in a new concept it's getting more and more difficult 
PBmtg414:1127	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1128	S2:	 i i had a erm a discussion er the day before yesterday er we went to [org7] and er we have this erm fun in food concept 
PBmtg414:1129	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1130	S2:	 and we started this fun in food concept at at erm er at [org7] and the results were very positive yeah i think we sold in average er and it was a combination of [thing1] with some other novelty products 
PBmtg414:1131	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1132	S3:	 a fun meter 
PBmtg414:1133	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1134	S2:	 yeah the fun meter and i think we in average we sold thirty euros a week er in sales
PBmtg414:1135	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1136	S2:	 and the rotations were b- betw- between four and seven a week 
PBmtg414:1137	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1138	S2:	 and so the result were very good and er and i had a discussion with a buyer er the day before yesterday and er and i told him okay er yeah we tested this er we tested this at at er ten stores and you said in the beginning okay when the results are very good you we would er x 
PBmtg414:1139	S3:	 expand 
PBmtg414:1140	S2:	 expand to do to do the distribution to t- the one hundred stores 
PBmtg414:1141	S3:	 the distribution mhm 
PBmtg414:1142	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1143	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1144	S2:	 you are having 
PBmtg414:1145	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1146	S2:	 and then he said no no no no we ain't gonna do that and i said why not he said because the rotations are too low and i said okay wh- what do you mean er he said no i need at least rotations of all the products of six seven because they are competing with other er sugar confectionery products and then i told him no you see it totally wrong the whole thing is that this sales is additional sales 
PBmtg414:1147	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1148	S2:	 cos when you buy er when you when you look at your shopping list you you put down candy there's not there's not the brand name so you put down candy 
PBmtg414:1149	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1150	S2:	 when you're in front of the shelf you buy a bag of candy and then all of a sudden you see a novelty product 
PBmtg414:1151	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1152	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1153	S2:	 and you buy that novelty product as well 
PBmtg414:1154	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1155	S2:	 you ain't gonna make a choice between a novelty product and candy 
PBmtg414:1156	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1157	S2:	 so you will always buy the candy when it's on your list and when you see the novelty 
PBmtg414:1158	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1159	S2:	 you buy that just for fun 
PBmtg414:1160	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1161	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1162	S2:	 okay and automatically the rotations will be lower yeah because you won't buy each day er a a novelty product but when you sell the novelty product it's one hundred per cent additional sales 
PBmtg414:1163	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1164	S2:	 one hundred per cent additional sales when don't place it over there you ain't gonna sell it 
PBmtg414:1165	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1166	S2:	 you know and this guy he kept on looking at me i- i- if it's all water burning i thought hey er

PBmtg414:1171	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg414:1175	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1176	S2:	 unbelievable this this perception on on er still well rotations are important and er 
PBmtg414:1177	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1178	S2:	 and this meter cost money you know and er 
PBmtg414:1179	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1180	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1181	S2:	 and a- and when you explain okay it's additional
PBmtg414:1182	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg414:1184	S2:	 it's one hundred per cent additional 
PBmtg414:1185	S3:	 mhm mhm

PBmtg414:1335	S4:	 and erm if you now compares the yield date figures er to each other you can see that there's a negative image but erm that's yeah that's because of the l- erm the loss of er [org3] er er dispensers 
PBmtg414:1336	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1337	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1338	S4:	 and erm we were selling er the dispens- in week twenty till week thirty-six er and the amount er of consumer sales was six- er sixty-seven thousand euros sales so that's that's the difference between the the figures
PBmtg414:1339	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1340	S4:	 but that's totally food so that's erm the this i- inclusive erm yeah the sales of [org3] erm the second graph shows you the er also development but then only in blisters and you can see that yeah it was a good er idea to to to erm yeah to take over all the blisters and er focus on blisters instead of standard bags
PBmtg414:1341	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1342	S5:	 so the yellows they are the dispensers
PBmtg414:1343	S4:	 er the yellow one is the the fruit refill 
PBmtg414:1344	S5:	 ah no x 
PBmtg414:1345	S5:	 the fruit ref- ah the refill fruit and cola okay 
PBmtg414:1346	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1347	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1348	S4:	 and the blues yeah it's the fruit and cola one and the other one is the
PBmtg414:1349	S5:	 and blue is 
PBmtg414:1350	S5:	 the red one is the dispenser 
PBmtg414:1351	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1352	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1353	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1354	S4:	 now you can see that's a very positive development yeah 
PBmtg414:1355	S5:	 mhm yeah 
PBmtg414:1356	S5:	 yeah xxx 
PBmtg414:1357	S3:	 hm 
PBmtg414:1358	S4:	 clear
PBmtg414:1359	S3:	 mhm then erm these are here you can see last data of food figures is that er total food
PBmtg414:1360	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1361	S4:	 and er you can compare last four weeks erm of two thousand and five versus the last weeks of two thousand six which are available now
PBmtg414:1362	S5:	 this is august ninth or which x x 
PBmtg414:1363	S4:	 twenty-ninth
PBmtg414:1364	S5:	 erm which the last thing was something yeah twenty-eight was the second week of july july 
PBmtg414:1365	S4:	 okay yeah 
PBmtg414:1366	S4:	 so you can yeah so you can make a comparison 
PBmtg414:1367	S5:	 july august 
PBmtg414:1368	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1369	S4:	 now if you look at the where the rate of sales xx you can see that there's an increase of rotation versus n- er last year and if you erm look at the distribution yeah the the difference here is that the yeah the loss of [org3] er dispensers 
PBmtg414:1370	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1371	S4:	 but these are very general figures and yeah it's i think it's better to go more in detail or but they er it's per clients there you can see erm a trend or a development 
PBmtg414:1372	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1373	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1374	S4:	 on the third line of each table you you can see the that's the dispenser the [org1] suikerhoudend gestoken fruit peg card 
PBmtg414:1375	S2:	 @@
PBmtg414:1376	S4:	 seventeen gram that's the that's the dispenser 
PBmtg414:1377	S2:	 mhm yes 
PBmtg414:1378	S5:	 the seventeen gram yeah 
PBmtg414:1379	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1380	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1381	S4:	 and if you compare the
PBmtg414:1382	S5:	 and so there is cola and fruit
PBmtg414:1383	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1384	S5:	 and it's the fifty-eight it's the minis i guess 
PBmtg414:1385	S4:	 yeah that's the standard bag with the minis yeah 
PBmtg414:1386	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1387	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1388	S4:	 and if you compare now the rotation figures er this year for instance er last year you can see an yeah enormous increase in er in rotation that's erm because of the displays in food 
PBmtg414:1389	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1390	S5:	 mhm that's true 
PBmtg414:1391	S3:	 hh and according your experience once you get a display er placed 
PBmtg414:1392	S4:	 mhm
PBmtg414:1393	S3:	 will it stay there or is it just for a few months it's it's very 
PBmtg414:1394	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1395	S4:	 yes i i think it is just for a few months weeks 
PBmtg414:1396	S3:	 aha and then it disappear 
PBmtg414:1397	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1398	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:1399	S4:	 because when you go to the figure of [org5] you can see that the distribution now has er decreased and er so we have to 
PBmtg414:1400	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1401	S4:	 erm to go back to the stores and erm 
PBmtg414:1402	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1403	S3:	 once again 
PBmtg414:1404	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1405	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1406	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1407	S5:	 and they inform you when they erm put away yeah it's just throw it away or i don't know 
PBmtg414:1408	S2:	 no 
PBmtg414:1409	S4:	 no 
PBmtg414:1410	S3:	 no they just 
PBmtg414:1411	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1412	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1413	S5:	 put it somewhere 
PBmtg414:1414	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1415	S2:	 tha- 
PBmtg414:1416	S4:	 but there are plac- 
PBmtg414:1417	S2:	 that's also why we said that we have to look more into especially in those stores where where it's more seasonal that we have to look into the carton ones because the investment in this this [thing5] is is er extremely high 
PBmtg414:1418	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1419	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1420	S5:	 it's xxx images it's like in in france no
PBmtg414:1421	S4:	 @@@
PBmtg414:1422	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1423	S2:	 and 
PBmtg414:1424	S2:	 yeah they just put it down and and after s- six or eight weeks er perhaps they reorder 
PBmtg414:1425	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1426	S2:	 and then after that per- after a period of sixteen weeks they kick it out and then they just throw it in the garbage or whatever 
PBmtg414:1427	S4:	 mhm it happens xxxx 
PBmtg414:1428	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1429	S2:	 and that's a waste of money 
PBmtg414:1430	S5:	 yeah sure 
PBmtg414:1431	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1432	S2:	 so it's it's far better then to use the carton ones and erm 
PBmtg414:1433	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1434	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1435	S5:	 because when they are gone then they okay 
PBmtg414:1436	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1437	S2:	 when they are gone okay that's it's made for that 
PBmtg414:1438	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1439	S5:	 throw it away mhm that's true 
PBmtg414:1440	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1441	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1442	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1443	S4:	 so we've received er the samples of the carton and they are now standing 
PBmtg414:1444	S5:	 ah yeah you received everything yeah mhm 
PBmtg414:1445	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1446	S4:	 yeah in our showroom and yeah we've passed our comment and 
PBmtg414:1447	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1448	S4:	 to go 
PBmtg414:1449	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1450	S4:	 to food stores and erm yeah er let them see the results of [org5] and 
PBmtg414:1451	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1452	S4:	 try to get a distribution of er those cartons
PBmtg414:1453	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1454	S3:	 mhm mhm right 
PBmtg414:1455	S2:	 but yeah that i- it's triple the sales yeah placing it er in a week in a week's time placing displays compared to er sales out of shelf that's thirteen compared to four 
PBmtg414:1456	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1457	S2:	 so that's er 
PBmtg414:1458	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm and that's really the average we have in in other countries as well 
PBmtg414:1459	S4:	 i mean it 
PBmtg414:1460	S2:	 yeah th- three times
PBmtg414:1461	S3:	 if we if we s- yah if we sell out out of shelf compared to the to display 
PBmtg414:1462	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1463	S3:	 mhm
PBmtg414:1464	S4:	 there you can see the the last x of [org6] erm okay the the erm the number of shops is er what we already told you around er three hundred and sixty and sixty-five shops are now selling [thing1] and that's erm also through er wholesalers
PBmtg414:1465	S3:	 most of them through or all of them 
PBmtg414:1466	S4:	 all 
PBmtg414:1467	S4:	 all of them i think 
PBmtg414:1468	S3:	 through wholesalers okay 
PBmtg414:1469	S2:	 [org6] 
PBmtg414:1470	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1471	S2:	 erm what what we did here is that we went to [org6] stores ourselves 
PBmtg414:1472	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1473	S2:	 what i told you and also 
PBmtg414:1474	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1475	S2:	 we went to the wholesalers 
PBmtg414:1476	S3:	 mhm about the delivery building 
PBmtg414:1477	S2:	 and and and tell them okay we will make distribution er you can make distribution yourself and you have to do the deliveries
PBmtg414:1478	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1479	S2:	 because 
PBmtg414:1480	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1481	S2:	 through head office we are not able er to get it through 
PBmtg414:1482	S3:	 to enter mhm 
PBmtg414:1483	S2:	 and er okay that resulted in er in sixty-five stores that of [org6] 
PBmtg414:1484	S3:	 mhm
PBmtg414:1485	S2:	 er so that's er yeah i think that's a good result 
PBmtg414:1486	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1487	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1488	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1489	S2:	 the for er for the first year er doing it like this and er 
PBmtg414:1490	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1491	S2:	 and rotations er [org6] er the rotations are a little bit less than in er @ in other stores but er l- l- between seven and eleven 
PBmtg414:1492	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1493	S2:	 okay it's er it's reasonably reasonable 
PBmtg414:1494	S3:	 mhm and who is doing the merchandising there the the wholesaler is doing everything
PBmtg414:1495	S2:	 er the the the wholesalers is do- yeah the wholesalers 
PBmtg414:1496	S3:	 they are allowed to enter the shop and and 
PBmtg414:1497	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1498	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1499	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:1500	S2:	 you know these er the [org6] has three hundred and sixty stores i think fifty per cent of those stores are owned by [org11] 
PBmtg414:1501	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1502	S2:	 and the other fifty per cent i- are independent er store owners 
PBmtg414:1503	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1504	S2:	 and so we go to the independent ones
PBmtg414:1505	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1506	S2:	 and the independent store owners are allowed to buy i think between five and ten per cent of the turnover not through [org11] organization but elsewhere and so er the the [org15] this o- the that's one of the wholesalers who actually goes to [org6] also with other products 
PBmtg414:1507	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1508	S2:	 and he also takes our products with him as well 
PBmtg414:1509	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1510	S2:	 we are now we are now having this guy called [org16] and it's it's an i think it's an an er an austrian organization who's entering the dutch market with their 
PBmtg414:1511	S4:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1512	S2:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1513	S3:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1514	S2:	 you know him
PBmtg414:1515	S3:	
PBmtg414:1516	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg414:1517	S3:	 maybe we can ask [first name1] but i've never heard it no 
PBmtg414:1518	S2:	 it's a wholesaler and he sells all kinds of things now in supermarkets in holland i think he's from austria 
PBmtg414:1519	S4:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1520	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1521	S3:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1522	S2:	 yeah [org16] okay 
PBmtg414:1523	S3:	 it's [org16] or 
PBmtg414:1524	S2:	 yeah [org16] i think
PBmtg414:1525	S4:	 [org16] 
PBmtg414:1526	S3:	 aha [org16] 
PBmtg414:1527	S2:	 yeah but 
PBmtg414:1528	S3:	 hm 
PBmtg414:1529	S5:	 never mind 
PBmtg414:1530	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1531	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1532	S5:	 so [org15] is one wholesaler 
PBmtg414:1533	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1534	S2:	 [org15] is one wholesaler but it's not only this the here is [org15] only mentioned but i i've a- there's also [org17] xx something 
PBmtg414:1535	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1536	S2:	 and er there will be [org18] xx something but [org15] is the 
PBmtg414:1537	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1538	S2:	 er the one who's dealing the most with the because we what we also said is that we selected some of the wholesalers 
PBmtg414:1539	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1540	S2:	 we wanted to work with 
PBmtg414:1541	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1542	S2:	 because when you do things like this 
PBmtg414:1543	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1544	S2:	 and and when you make distribution in a supermarket and you bring it to er let's say a more of our less erm er well-organized er wholesaler 
PBmtg414:1545	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1546	S2:	 you will lose the business anyhow so er you make hh 
PBmtg414:1547	S4:	 yeah hm that's true 
PBmtg414:1548	S2:	 so we we selected the three wholesalers in the northern part of holland and erm we want to actively work with them that's also the part of the relationship you can only do it when you say okay we work actively w- with with with a project like this 
PBmtg414:1549	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1550	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1551	S3:	 and very closely
PBmtg414:1552	S2:	 and very closely 
PBmtg414:1553	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1554	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1555	S2:	 our account manager [first name7] [last name7] there is er he has a good relationship there with er 
PBmtg414:1556	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1557	S2:	 those guys and also it's not only the it's not only er the [thing1] displays he is s- selling because he also we we you know we also have this this general rack er where [thing1] is part of you know it'll also also [thing7] products involved as well 
PBmtg414:1558	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1559	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1560	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1561	S2:	 and he er he made the same deal with er with [org15] the with their one one sales rep of [org15] that he could actually sell in those general racks at [org6] as well so er i think 
PBmtg414:1562	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1563	S2:	 the sixty-five shops it's not only the [thing1] rack but that's also some of them will have the general rack
PBmtg414:1564	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1565	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1566	S2:	 so 
PBmtg414:1567	S3:	 mhm very good 
PBmtg414:1568	S2:	 we have to do a lot of er erm teaching er teach the trade that novelties can actually sell and that's er we have to change the the perception of the the buyers that er 
PBmtg414:1569	S5:	 @@
PBmtg414:1570	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1571	S2:	 that it's not only sugar confectionery which we have to sell out of that er out of the store but that you can sell novelties also 
PBmtg414:1572	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1573	S4:	 then erm yeah the very good results of [org5] and erm yeah you can see the enormous er increase of sales in er euro sales 
PBmtg414:1574	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1575	S4:	 and erm and you can also see that the rotation is yeah very high twenty-nine week seven seventy-one a week er fifty-eight a week thirty-one a week that's 
PBmtg414:1576	S2:	 [org5] is a real family store 
PBmtg414:1577	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1578	S4:	 pure 
PBmtg414:1579	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1580	S2:	 and that's that's also what you see on the results 
PBmtg414:1581	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1582	S2:	 er er rotations of er sixty er @ between sixty and forty a week that's that's high 
PBmtg414:1583	S3:	 that's very high 
PBmtg414:1584	S4:	 very high

PBmtg414:1592	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1593	S4:	 the distribution at this moment is ten nine 
PBmtg414:1594	S2:	 ten per cent 
PBmtg414:1595	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1596	S3:	 and this is direct delivery
PBmtg414:1597	S2:	 no

PBmtg414:1601	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1602	S3:	 okay

PBmtg414:1605	S2:	 to the buyer 
PBmtg414:1606	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1607	S2:	 explaining okay when you don't wanna have it in the confectionery shelf in a way it's fine with me but then at least place one display 
PBmtg414:1608	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah mhm 
PBmtg414:1609	S2:	 and try it during the season place a display with er two hundred s k us in it and you will sell it in er in four weeks' time 
PBmtg414:1610	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1611	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1612	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg414:1641	S5:	 private label is big part 
PBmtg414:1642	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1643	S3:	 very similar to the u k in the u k you have more than thirty per cent 
PBmtg414:1644	S5:	 are you cold
PBmtg414:1645	S3:	 and every big chain has their own private label 
PBmtg414:1646	S4:	 no no

PBmtg414:1653	S2:	 you know with private labels all the products which are er let's say commodity and that's wine gums what we talked about yesterday 
PBmtg414:1654	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1655	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1656	S2:	 it's commodity and why why will you bring it why should you bring it under a private l- of under under a brand
PBmtg414:1657	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1658	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1659	S2:	 when you can also bring it in in a private label 
PBmtg414:1660	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1661	S2:	 or use [org20] because it's also er value for money er priced 
PBmtg414:1662	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1663	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1664	S2:	 but er yeah okay erm a- all the retailers selling [org20] y- you you they all want to be different than others so they they only erm they think that the only way to be different is use private labels yeah put their own br- their own name on it er and er hh yeah okay er 
PBmtg414:1665	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1666	S2:	 it's real threat for brands 
PBmtg414:1667	S3:	 but the price war in the in the u k for example is incredible because er i just recently did some store checks and i saw mainly that the gums and jellies are buy one get one free i mean nobody nobody earns money any more 
PBmtg414:1668	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1669	S3:	 you know or just take three out of your choice for one pound so it's incredible and and every shelf was fully packed with with a incredible 
PBmtg414:1670	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1671	S3:	 price quotation 
PBmtg414:1672	S2:	 this er in in in england er the the market is really under pressure 
PBmtg414:1673	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1674	S2:	 especially after the n- let's say the normal sugar confectionery product and it has a lot to do with the obesitas discussion 
PBmtg414:1675	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1676	S2:	 yeah and also the government now is really involved of of highly involved in er in er in in getting out the i think they even 
PBmtg414:1677	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1678	S2:	 will start with stamps on the products saying okay this is a bad product this is a little bit better and this is be- you know with coloring 
PBmtg414:1679	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1680	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1681	S2:	 so communication towards the consumer on how many calories are there in this this packaging 
PBmtg414:1682	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1683	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1684	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1685	S2:	 and erm i know that we er that our organization is now entering with a whole new wellness er range 
PBmtg414:1686	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1687	S2:	 so let's say sugar-reduced products products with thirty-five per cent less sugar 
PBmtg414:1688	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1689	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1690	S2:	 and add vitamins to it or add calcium to it or whatever so 
PBmtg414:1691	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1692	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1693	S2:	 yeah the the taste of the product must be okay
PBmtg414:1694	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1695	S2:	 er reduce a little bit of sugar so that we that the the the calorie contained will will 
PBmtg414:1696	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1697	S2:	 be lower 
PBmtg414:1698	S3:	 will yeah 
PBmtg414:1699	S2:	 and we add vitamins or we add whatever 
PBmtg414:1700	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1701	S2:	 so to make er sugar confectionery a little bit more healthy it will never be healthy 
PBmtg414:1702	S3:	 to make it a bit 
PBmtg414:1703	S3:	 more h- 
PBmtg414:1704	S3:	 healthier 
PBmtg414:1705	S3:	 mhm yeah yeah yeah right right 
PBmtg414:1706	S2:	 yeah but er it's l- l- l- less erm er less unhealthy 
PBmtg414:1707	S5:	 that's nasty 
PBmtg414:1708	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1709	S3:	 but the obesity issue is is not that big in your country isn't it 
PBmtg414:1710	S2:	 yeah it's starting 
PBmtg414:1711	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg414:1712	S2:	 it's starting it's real starting and er you also of of er sugar er sugar-free and sugarless products entering the dutch market and the the government is is er there is a lot of publicity a- amongst er obesitas as well in holland 
PBmtg414:1713	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1714	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1715	S2:	 and erm it's sort of in in england they try to keep the volume on a high level by making er it one plus one activities 
PBmtg414:1716	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1717	S2:	 and erm 
PBmtg414:1718	S3:	 right 
PBmtg414:1719	S2:	 that's the the only reason why they do it 
PBmtg414:1720	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1721	S2:	 but in holland we we see also a lot of er er pub- publications on obesitas and one one erm 
PBmtg414:1722	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1723	S2:	 one out of the four children is already too too heavy and i think okay w- w- we as as 
PBmtg414:1724	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1725	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1726	S2:	 we as industry we know that it has nothing to do with with eating candies because in holland we alrea- we are i think at least the last five years on an average er candy intake of six kilos a year 
PBmtg414:1727	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1728	S2:	 six point two there is no increase in it 
PBmtg414:1729	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1730	S2:	 so it's six point two already for ten years 
PBmtg414:1731	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1732	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1733	S2:	 and children are getting thicker and thicker and that has nothing to do with the with the calorie intake 
PBmtg414:1734	S3:	 no no no that's 
PBmtg414:1735	S2:	 in sugar confectionery it has everything to do with movement 
PBmtg414:1736	S3:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1737	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1738	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1739	S2:	 they don't play they don't sport any more they don't play any more they sit behind their the desk behind the computer 
PBmtg414:1740	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1741	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1742	S3:	 play any more right

PBmtg414:1750	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1751	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1752	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1753	S3:	 right mhm 
PBmtg414:1754	S5:	 and the whole nutrition not not only the the candies it's
PBmtg414:1755	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1756	S2:	 it's not only the it's er but okay now you know 
PBmtg414:1757	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1758	S5:	 what they eat the whole day 
PBmtg414:1759	S2:	 f- five years ago or ten years ago the government said okay smoking is a bad habit so er everything what had to do with smoking had to kick- be kicked out of the country no advertising 
PBmtg414:1760	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1761	S2:	 er and now it's er now it's that now it's and then it was er alcohol 
PBmtg414:1762	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1763	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1764	S2:	 and now it's sugar confectionery 
PBmtg414:1765	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1766	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1767	S2:	 so each time they take another se- another category 
PBmtg414:1768	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm in a few years it it'll it will switch to
PBmtg414:1769	S2:	 in a few years 
PBmtg414:1770	S3:	 smoking again 
PBmtg414:1771	S2:	 yeah it will switch to smoking again or t- to driving yeah stop driving cars and er

PBmtg414:1775	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1776	S2:	 and erm 
PBmtg414:1777	S3:	 mhm mhm

PBmtg414:1780	S2:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1781	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1782	S4:	 that's also very popular now 
PBmtg414:1783	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1784	S4:	 b- because it's a big problem er 
PBmtg414:1785	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1786	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1787	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1788	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1789	S5:	 and for the for the sugar-free candies it's then tooth-friendly logo is this erm 
PBmtg414:1790	S2:	 hh yeah 
PBmtg414:1791	S5:	 has this an important issue in in holland 
PBmtg414:1792	S2:	 no not no b- the the the that it's su- i i and that'll sugar-free is still not important and the feedback and that's also story y- you know wha- what we are doing on the [thing7] is also go more natural try to get 
PBmtg414:1793	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1794	S2:	 sugar-reduced products and also add vitamins to it 
PBmtg414:1795	S3:	 na- 
PBmtg414:1796	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1797	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1798	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1799	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1800	S2:	 and but sugar-free the disadvantage and that's a- the in the perception of the buyer as well er ninety per cent of the sugar-free products are not that tasty 
PBmtg414:1801	S3:	 yeah right 
PBmtg414:1802	S2:	 so when you take a wine gum 
PBmtg414:1803	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1804	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1805	S2:	 er just a normal wine gum 
PBmtg414:1806	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1807	S2:	 and you compare that with a sugar-free wine gum 
PBmtg414:1808	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1809	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1810	S2:	 the sugar-free that's always a n- a next taste it's you know an aftertaste which is awful 
PBmtg414:1811	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1812	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1813	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1814	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah mhm 
PBmtg414:1815	S2:	 and and that's also what the buyers think and that's also the feedback you're getting from consumers 
PBmtg414:1816	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1817	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1818	S3:	 that's right 
PBmtg414:1819	S2:	 so and er 
PBmtg414:1820	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1821	S2:	 so the thing is now that people are trying to develop sugar-free candies which actually do taste
PBmtg414:1822	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1823	S2:	 but that's s- s- still very difficult 
PBmtg414:1824	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1825	S2:	 and erm 
PBmtg414:1826	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1827	S2:	 we have an we have n- we now have an er an er marshmallow a sugar-free marshmallow er and you can't taste the difference between the sugar-free one and the sugar-containing one
PBmtg414:1828	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1829	S2:	 erm but it's expensive it's very expensive 
PBmtg414:1830	S3:	 right 
PBmtg414:1831	S3:	 there is a 
PBmtg414:1832	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1833	S3:	 price difference 
PBmtg414:1834	S2:	 it yeah i- it it's there's p- price difference of forty per cent 
PBmtg414:1835	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1836	S3:	 wow 
PBmtg414:1837	S5:	 wow 
PBmtg414:1838	S3:	 mhm yeah due to the ingredients of course mhm 
PBmtg414:1839	S2:	 you know and then and then you have this consumer price and normally you buy a bag of marshmallows this big 
PBmtg414:1840	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1841	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1842	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1843	S2:	 for one and a half euros 
PBmtg414:1844	S3:	 right 
PBmtg414:1845	S2:	 and now we will try to sell a bag of hundred and fifty grams for one and a half euros you know and and that's 
PBmtg414:1846	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1847	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1848	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1849	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1850	S2:	 hh and there is and then the qu- the big question mark is is is the consumer willing 
PBmtg414:1851	S3:	 willing to pay for it 
PBmtg414:1852	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1853	S2:	 to pay for it 
PBmtg414:1854	S3:	 right right right 
PBmtg414:1855	S2:	 and er 
PBmtg414:1856	S5:	 maybe a special group but 
PBmtg414:1857	S2:	 hh there is also a s- there is aw- there is always a special group who is willing to do that 
PBmtg414:1858	S5:	 yeah but 
PBmtg414:1859	S2:	 on the other hand we also say eating candy everyone knows that eating candy is is erm tha- that it gives calories 
PBmtg414:1860	S3:	 calorie 
PBmtg414:1861	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1862	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1863	S2:	 and everyone knows that eating candy is not good for your he- for your life or for your for your health as long as you er 
PBmtg414:1864	S3:	 don't o- 
PBmtg414:1865	S2:	 you ca- you can eat candy today
PBmtg414:1866	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1867	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1868	S2:	 and then okay don't eat candy tomorrow go sporting and and it's and it's fine
PBmtg414:1869	S5:	 mhm yeah that's
PBmtg414:1870	S5:	 yeah mhm 
PBmtg414:1871	S2:	 and everyone knows that and people actually er it's still my belief that then that people buy a bag of candy they eat it because they like at that moment and they just fo- they they think 
PBmtg414:1872	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1873	S3:	 forget about the rest 
PBmtg414:1874	S2:	 forget about the rest 
PBmtg414:1875	S3:	 mhm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:1876	S2:	 come on er and knowing that then when you when you go in that that thinking er you when you entered in a market you you can bring a sugar- -less product or a sugar- or a sugar-free or whatever 
PBmtg414:1877	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1878	S2:	 erm 
PBmtg414:1879	S3:	 or sugar-reduced 
PBmtg414:1880	S2:	 but don't put too much er er communication am- amongst there just tell them that it is a good product 
PBmtg414:1881	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1882	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1883	S2:	 and that it's of high taste and that you don't see the difference between er the sugar-containing one and the sugar-free one 
PBmtg414:1884	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1885	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1886	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:1887	S2:	 er and it's oh it's nice to have it it's also sugar-free 
PBmtg414:1888	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg414:1892	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1893	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:1894	S2:	 and you don't have the disadvantage of the calories
PBmtg414:1895	S5:	 of the calories yeah 
PBmtg414:1896	S3:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1897	S2:	 and that's but that's not the main task of the m- the main reason for buying candy is t- is is people know that it's not good for your your health but they just like it 
PBmtg414:1898	S3:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg414:1899	S2:	 just to eat it

PBmtg414:2602	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg414:2603	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:2604	S3:	 [org26] or [org26] or what 
PBmtg414:2605	S2:	 [org26] 
PBmtg414:2606	S4:	 [org26] 
PBmtg414:2607	S3:	 [org26] 
PBmtg414:2608	S2:	 yeah we will change that er this year also because i don't like the coloring of er the [org26] logo it's er it's a little bi- it's it's a little bit cheap 
PBmtg414:2609	S5:	 and does stand f- stand for anything
PBmtg414:2610	S2:	 yeah no 
PBmtg414:2611	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg414:2612	S2:	 no 
PBmtg414:2613	S5:	 entschuldigung 
PBmtg414:2614	S3:	 bitte mhm nice mhm 
PBmtg414:2615	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:2616	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:2617	S3:	 very nice 
PBmtg414:2618	S2:	 and yeah with seasonal products it's always a problem to get new seasonal products in because what the trade normally does is they l- they look at what did we did last year 
PBmtg414:2619	S5:	 xx i know from my childhood 
PBmtg414:2620	S4:	 mhm yeah 
PBmtg414:2621	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg414:2622	S2:	 and we do exactly the same this year 
PBmtg414:2623	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:2624	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah and that's it 
PBmtg414:2625	S2:	 and that's it and they don't take the time to really look at new concepts so er okay when you start up a new concept and you sell nearly thirty thousand bags m- yeah as a start 
PBmtg414:2626	S3:	 it's a good signal 
PBmtg414:2627	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg414:2628	S2:	 it's it's a good signal

PBmtg414:2632	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg414:2633	S3:	 mhm
PBmtg414:2634	S2:	 and it's i think that's good for [org1] yeah because you communicate the the dispensers also in er in other stores and er in an another way
