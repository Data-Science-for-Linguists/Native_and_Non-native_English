            <note xml:id="PRpan1_tn_0">This is a panel discussion on the topic of women in the Islamic world and the question of modernity. There is a short introductory statement by a representative (S1) of the forum where the panel discussion is held. Then the chair (S2) takes over and introduces the four panellists (S3, S4, S5, S6), all of whom are professors and lecturers of different disciplines, but concerned with gender studies and women rights in their discipline. Each of the panellists gives a short talk on different aspects of the question of women in Islam and modernity. Afterwards there is discussion with the audience. There are about 100 people present in the audience, thus the panellists as well as the people posing questions afterwards usually speak into microphones. Towards the end, the discussion gets rather heated as people from the audience verbally attack panellists and the chair person, but the situation is regulated by the chair person. </note>
