EDsed362:87	S8:	 erm so first of all erm as you already know there are many definitions of erm terrorism so we think that the most important is to erm define terrorism and to to create a s- of well part of a sort a sort of x definition that every country will erm respect and comply to and erm we're gonna give you an example erm erm and that shows erm er the definition that has many cause and [S9] will talk about it 
EDsed362:88	S9:	 er okay this is the definition of international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism in nineteen ninety-nine any act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to civilian or to any other person not taking part in the hostilities in a situation of foreign conflict when the purpose of such act by its nature or context is to intimidate a population or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to s- obtain from doing any act okay my first question is why only bodily injury when it can be also subject not only to bodily injury then the second why should be restricted only for civilians when it can be also erm military and the third one er what is population and why only population why not also single individuals
EDsed362:89	S8:	 and erm why we think that definition is important er because erm you know if we had the wide definition that no country could or just call anything erm a te- terrorism you know what suites them for all their foreign policy or erm domestic policy erm you know they couldn't use some things as er excuse and erm you know declare a war on terrorism and yeah 
EDsed362:90	S10:	 okay our second basic assumption is that if you want to combat something we should know er we should be se- we should see its main causes er to go to its root so we decided that main causes of the terrorism are global problems economic political social so being assumption is i- if you want to fight terrorism we we erm we must fight has to tackle global problems er the terrorism exists for centuries as we know hh but only in the turn of this century became so a key a problem of terrorism it became total catastrophic global so because of this global problems so we can er list among this global problems the problem of peace and war just the number erm we erm w xx number xx xx and also the problem of rogues deeds also we should quiet ecological degradation because it also can m- be the main cause of er terrorism also the pro- we er have heard a lot about the problem of er north er north south gap that is the under er er huge gap economical er gap between er in the development of north northern countries developed countries and underdeveloped so we should also tackle this problem and also we should tackle the social problems among which is the problem of diseases aids pandem- er pandemias er also hh erm problem of population explosion in underdeveloped er regions of the world and also we should o- o- of course er tackle er global political problems as we know er the terrorism is caused erm w- er primarily by political reasons er political oppression that's why er we should adjust somehow insure that demo- of democratic states in the world just gradually increases if er how er as we know according to the theory of the democratic peace the more democratic states appear the it's more stable the world is hh so er there this by these means we could just f- fight terrorism thank you
