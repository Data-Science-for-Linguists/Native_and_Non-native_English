PBsve426:46	S2:	 so that we're sure that everything is okay so but in case so in case you don't have to pay for september the administration fee would be five hundred twenty-five this would be from october till december two thousand and three then for the whole year two thousand four two thousand five and the nine months if you prolong 
PBsve426:47	S1:	 mhm

PBsve426:50	S2:	 yes and i could offer you if you sh- if you show me the confirmation that you paid another deposit in [place1] then i could use the deposit of four hundred euro for part of the administration fee hh and then you erm just would have to pay one hundred twenty-five euro and afterwards i could care for the prolongation
PBsve426:51	S1:	 mhm
PBsve426:52	S2:	 because you have to pay for all acc- er for for the whole ad- administration fee before i can care for a pro- er prolongation
