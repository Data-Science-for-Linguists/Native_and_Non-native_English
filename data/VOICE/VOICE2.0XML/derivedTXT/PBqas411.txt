PBqas411:1	S1:	 i was interested that you selected a cast of a hundred and eighty millimetres thickness or hh up two hundred m- and more hh and yet xxxx in [place1] of course those put in one of their earliest medium thick cast er as an eighty millimetre thick cast er was there some fundamental reason for going back to a thicker cast or was it to get a higher throughput hh or is it that the xx xx xx is able to cope with a thicker slab
PBqas411:2	S2:	 er our our constructional production departments have been hh have been invested in previously in such way that er er it was the how to say most er er understandable way to proceed in that way how we have done @@ er we have a if i understood correctly so you're asking at w- why why to have thick slabs hh instead of thins hh so we have a very strong xx for example and er er we can utilize that capacity in the future as well and and our basical aim is to reach those volumes what what er what are in forms 
PBqas411:3	S3:	 next question please maybe in the meantime one question to mister [S4/last] hh how do you see the future of the european stainless steel maker hh in spite of the development er which actually you have drawn up in china 
PBqas411:4	S4:	 er i could make it easy now like mister [last name1] and say well very bright end of er my answer but i would say the cl- the cl- the sky is far from being cloudless for the european producers hh er one reason being definitely hh and all y- you all know that the european mills shipped in the last years a lot of hot rolled coils for rerolling to asia hh the asian mills are becoming self-sufficient so this business falls away hh on the other side we are seeing more and more even it's not a big volume yet asian material coming to the european market hh er taiwan korea all already big suppliers to the european market and the tendency is growing so hh also this bites into the in all european producers' home market share hh and the third reason and this is the biggest is that we have not enough growth in our markets and one reason is also that hh there are a lot of finished products simple finished products made from stainless steel that are imported from asia into europe hh er just go to a you know hardware store or grocery store or to a xx a a big department store and er look where the pots and pans and the cutlery and whatever is in there xxx where it's produced so hh er today already about fifty per cent of the stainless steel market is durable consumer goods it's not the tanks and the investment goods any more it's the growth comes from the durable hh consumer goods and some of them are relatively simple hh and here this is the biggest risk that these simple products are being manufactured somewhere else so hh all of these three factors together point to the direction that by the year two thousand ten there could be about two million tons of hot-rolled material and one million ton of cold-rolled material market hh that we have today as european producers hh which are not available any more what that means everybody can draw his own conclusions hh erm if there is such an oversupply situation something's gotta give so who will it be that's the question
PBqas411:5	S3:	 thank you 
PBqas411:6	S5:	 next question i'm [S5] hello i am [S5] [S5/last] from the [org1] i have a small question for mister [S6/last] er xx yes when did you going to a presentation i understand you are having er high quality of prime of annealing and xx hh which is almost ninety-five percentage but i would like to know that what other defects you are having in the xx x 
PBqas411:7	S6:	 norm- normally we we have a kind of scratch in the end of the the the the coils hh it's a common er defect of the xx mill hh and some marks something like that but hh er you can say that xx today you have a good quality for xxx 
PBqas411:8	S5:	 any problems regarding the slivers 
PBqas411:9	S6:	 yes yes but er 
PBqas411:10	S5:	 xxx 
PBqas411:11	S6:	 it's around two per cent 
PBqas411:12	S5:	 only two per cent at at the annealing xx stage 
PBqas411:13	S6:	 yes 
PBqas411:14	S6:	 yes 
PBqas411:15	S5:	 hm okay but er are the slivers i mean er any specific observations regarding of the xxx from caster or from heating furnace or something like that
PBqas411:16	S6:	 er in these cases only for the the hot steel mill responsible 
PBqas411:17	S5:	 for slivers also i'm talking about slivers now specifically 
PBqas411:18	S6:	 pardon
PBqas411:19	S5:	 slivers slivers slivers 
PBqas411:20	S6:	 slivers yes 
PBqas411:21	S5:	 xxx xx very from hot xx 
PBqas411:22	S6:	 yes two per cent are out 
PBqas411:23	S5:	 from er er any specific xxx i mean the heating furnace temperatures or something like that going wrong xx heating of slabs is it er any analysis or something in that field
PBqas411:24	S6:	 [S7/last] can answer for me
PBqas411:25	SX-7:	 xxxxxxxx 
PBqas411:26	SX-6:	 yeah xxx xxxxx 
PBqas411:27	S7:	 just now we are studying if these effects cames from stack of mi- er stack of o- no from the the he- heating furnace or er melting shop 
PBqas411:28	S5:	 yeah that's why that's x 
PBqas411:29	S7:	 but you know that most of the defect cames from melting shop 
PBqas411:30	S5:	 melting shop 
PBqas411:31	S7:	 yes 
PBqas411:32	S5:	 the worst xxx when xxxx that if the slabs are overheated in the heating furnace there also xx the slivers in stainless steel mainly xxxx 
PBqas411:33	S7:	 yes 
PBqas411:34	S5:	 do you like to say something i mean xx would you like to share your experience on this 
PBqas411:35	SX-m:	 xxxx 
PBqas411:36	SX-8:	 xxxx xxx 
PBqas411:37	S7:	 please er er er i i c- i c- i do- i didn't understand your question
PBqas411:38	S5:	 er yes i was just trying to find out whether the slabs if are they're overheated or h- exposed to high temperature in the heating furnace it leads to oxidation of the xx xxx xxx slivers 
PBqas411:39	S8:	 please i i i would er we are er late and maybe the the best way hh is to have er discussion er er er xx discussion 
PBqas411:40	S6:	 okay 
PBqas411:41	S8:	 and er after the meeting please 
PBqas411:42	S5:	 du- 
PBqas411:43	S5:	 during the dinner 
PBqas411:44	S8:	 please 
PBqas411:45	S3:	 are there some other questions please
PBqas411:46	S9:	 hh er [S9/last] [org2] s- steel i have a question to the experts at the podium we have heard in the presentation that er grinding loss went down from four per cent to two per cent that was back in the seventies hh now i would like to know hh er what is modern grinding loss nowadays on austenitic and ferritic grades and what will the future outlook be
PBqas411:47	S3:	 mister [S10/last] please
PBqas411:48	S10:	 yeah mister [S9/last] that's a very tough question and there are sitting many experts around so y- we will have maybe one hundred opinions on that i would say firstly it depends on the application on the final application and if we talk about normal austenitic grades for no special application and not the let's say a normal three o four then we are talking now that about er nine- more than ninety per cent of the slabs practically are not ground and if you would make some restrictions to exclude some slabs start and end and whatever hh it might be near one hundred per cent for more er dif- er for more er specific grades like titanium er grades still the high majority is ground and i do not see in the moment the absolute trend to get rid of that and other steel grades are somewhere in between and very big er differences we see in the ferritic stainless steel grades where a cust- a a a supplier like [org3] is practically doing no grinding but many other producers still grind i would say maybe twenty to fifty per cent of them and the average grinding loss in weight er we would need to calculate according to that because the the grinding er erm the grinding depths did not change so dramatically so still you need to grind a a certain depth of one to two millimetre to get rid of defects if there would be one i hope this is sufficient otherwise i would hand over to mister [S2/last] @@
PBqas411:49	S2:	 very good answer 
PBqas411:50	S3:	 okay to the the reason that actually we are a bit late today i would say that we should ask the auditorium maybe for one or two questions hh is there anything
PBqas411:51	S11:	 er [S11] [S11/last] er [org4] er a question to [S4] [S4/last] mister [S4/last] erm regarding the two hundred grades you mentioned the substitution potential well i think er if you take er manganese as substitute hh er don't you think that the manganese price will er increase and play also a significant role in the economics in the substituti- of the substitution
PBqas411:52	S4:	 why er manganese is one of the most abundant elements in on the earth right and we've you see er manganese is produced rather like chromium in a ferro- you know ferroalloy plant in a ferroalloy smelter hh to build a plant that gives you hundred thousand tons of manganese er the investment will be most likely less than hundred million dollars hh for fifty thousand tons of nickel like xxx you know the big projects we are having right now hh you have to spend a billion dollars to two billion dollars so ni- the nickel production will always be or er more expensive hh er and also even you know that we know now that these p a l projects in australia the pressure acid leaching process hh that this did not bring the results that were desired hh so i think no erm even if the industry switches over with manganese they will always have a lower cost raw material than with nickel hh and there is no shortage whatsoever yah of of manganese not in the earth and hh er at the end of the day er n- not in in the refining capacity 
PBqas411:53	S11:	 thank you 
PBqas411:54	S4:	 my pleasure 
PBqas411:55	S3:	 last question please so if there is no last question i'd like to make an announcement hh the departure for the buses are actually after our session just outside hh for picking up to the hotel hh and from the hotel basically the buses will pick you up at eighteen thirty hh that means six thirty er which actually bring you to our evening event and er i really would like to underline don't miss this evening event hh you will be very impressed and actually also at the end now i would like to thank all the speakers i'd like to thank to the auditorium which actually have been for this evening the best auditorium hh er what my feeling is and i think my colleague also can underline the same thank you very much
