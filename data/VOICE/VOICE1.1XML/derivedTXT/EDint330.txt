EDint330:159	S1:	 yes 
EDint330:160	S3:	 er there is a big difficult of there is bit er big el- a big difficulty for translators because not everybody knows how to translate

EDint330:171	S3:	 no no no 
EDint330:172	S3:	 yes it should stay like this as it is if they want to know more maltese i mean the parents have to give them a bit more
