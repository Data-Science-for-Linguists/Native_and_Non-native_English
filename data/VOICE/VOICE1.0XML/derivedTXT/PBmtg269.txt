PBmtg269:58	S3:	 okay so i will sit there if you don't mind okey-dokey hh i would like to take you brief through the er i've been thinking because i think that er at the level of evaluating of the [org5] proposals in the countries it's it's important to understand what was really what the agency was asked for i think that reference documents always should be created brief er because this was really originally what agency was asked for at the original level and er i am think that this should be valid also on the country level so that's why i would like to start with the creative brief highlighting the mo- the most important elements of the creative brief which er i mean for me was the most important when thinking about what offer [org5] er er came to us er as a proposal hh er then we will switch and talk p r concept and p r contract er er p r program template because we agreed er working with the [org5] that someth- something like a manual of executional elements will be accepted across the hh er across the region and the countries will have kind of flexibility of choosing the elements from the manual when thinking about the program for every single country then we will go to the p r budget which is erm i think that's sensitive topic 
PBmtg269:59	SX-f:	 hm 
PBmtg269:60	S3:	 er then p r communication er the key elements of the communication which are not finished yet but i have er at least er i'm going to show you whatever i have er potential issues are a part of the communication then we will go into the [org5] responsibility to let you understand what was the split of the responsibilities between regional and country and what we you can expect from the agency on the regional level and what is the exclusive responsibility of the [org5] in the country hey er then we will agreed something on er hh what i think are next steps for timetable which we should probably think er of and er i will i have for you the c d that we call it toolbox whatever was er any documents which might be of interest of you from the legal perspective from the q and as perspective message trucking or whatever our presentation is on the c ds i put it everything for you so you will have a kind of library of reference of thinking of any problem which i xxxx er in the meantime when working on the project okay so let's have a brief of objective as i said er the tool er elements which end up to be very appro- important in this project were er the following one was we been thinking that we are together with the advertising communications should educate consumers hh er and the fac- er second things which we've been thinking about because this project is kind of risky one at least erm we've evaluated as er kind of risky erm project we been thinking that er in front an advanced addressing polemic er arguments from the perspective of governments er from er from government and non-governmental organizations and this is a point which we have to think about er when thinking about p r program so one is p r communication the other is stakeholders stakeholder to address this big questions but er when the questions are addressed the best things is er is probably to involve them so er later i will show you that we've been thinking about how to involve er stakeholders to let them communicate next to us that this project is important this is the right thing to do er assignment as we said er strong educational elements against consumers should be a part of the p r program and in p r pro- program proposal which in agency was asked to come with and then erm a communication platform that says er which are including false stakeholders and led them to support us with our project hh the target audience was er assigned as as housewives very very very very wide because this is everything erm basically the same consumer who use our [thing1] but it's even more complicated because it's not premature user it's just user of [thing1] so er very wide one also government and agencies n g os er were er are target audience for the p r communication hh and of course er media media via which we would like to achieve consumers and also governmental non-governmental er organizations er this is an abstract from creative brief which you probably have noticed this is all about er the the the er the consumer what consumers might think the big issue is what consumers might think about our project they might think basically that they are cheated because they get less powder for the same amount of money so there is a high risk of overdosing er at the process of switching from one to another [thing1] and in the process of learning how to use new [thing1] er which arrived just arrived on the market just in one step so suddenly overnight and w- we will er wake up in the in a new situation when there is only or in the short period of time the only [thing1] very much concen- much more concentrated on the market okay so er this is the reality we have to face this is the the the the biggest risk from the perspective of consumers and probably consumers' organizations as such er key messages erm key messages this is er another things which we have er how to say there is always er d- discussions around because on one hand the key and major message which we would like to be transferred to the consumers that our [thing1] are er thirty-three per cent more compacted and v- via this are more convenient for the for in in usage okay but on the other hand er the point is that by the way this is an environmental aspect in this so our [thing1] will be probably via this reduction will be probably will be via this reduction er more environmental friendly or no [thing1] cannot be environmental friendly [thing1] are er less harmful from environment am i right
PBmtg269:61	S1:	 good okay 
PBmtg269:62	S3:	 yeah so and er in this communication we have to find a balance because on one hand this is er very tempting to use this environmental messages however but on the other hand we as er producers will be not credible why we are using this environmental messages so er the communication should be erm constructed the way that we as er producers will be saying just basically about er thirty-three perte- per cent compaction which is more convenient for the consumer in usage on the other hand our st- potential stakeholders supporters should say about any environmental messages which might be at the by the way so a- i- and it there is a hel- there is a chance and erm potentially hope that this two messages will somehow mix in the perception of the consumers okay so key messages is major step to a reduction of the environmental impact across the whole europe by promoting and encoring the reduction of chemicals packaging and ener- energy saving production xxx in use this is very primary but it's very tough for us to to defend it so compact [thing1] provide more convenience by using less [thing1] to wash the same amount of laundry this is a key message for for producers and for the [org4] okay the second key message is that the first will happened so the changed compaction is the major step to a reduction of environmental impact will alwa- only happens and the second will only hap- only happens that the consumer will get more convenience er when consumers will adapt new habits when washing meaning will use er aqu- appropriate dosing thirty-three per cent less will fill up the machine up to the er er will not wash with underfilling condition and will use recommended low temperature because then there is possible energy saving which is the beauty behind this project also for consumers okay any questions so far am i talking too much
PBmtg269:63	SS:	 @

PBmtg269:127	S2:	 which is easier for him than for me for example therefore we decided he would do that now in the association if [org2] cannot provide us with somebody who can take the lead then of course we have to take the lead

PBmtg269:155	S3:	 erm 
PBmtg269:156	S1:	 who caused one @@ @
PBmtg269:157	S3:	 and er so especially in the situation when we have er when there is no independent person from the association side no secretary no director it's important to have the stok- stakeholders on er right next to us during press conferences and the occasions to communicate the project to the external world so that will be someone who will say next to [org4] next to producers who at the end of the day this national er national associations who will say that this is right thing to do yeah and independent expert if anything happened also would be a nice idea to have hh okay hh so this was agency was briefed like that was briefed also with the budget we will switch to the budget er points later on the p r program assumption was that as it was settled by the one regional p r agency what will be with the project er across the whole region er the countries which were er to be er covered with the project is at the end of the day sixteen however er it will happen over a the time of two years but not regionally in spring in spring we will have coordinate six countries
PBmtg269:158	S1:	 seven or eight seven 
PBmtg269:159	S2:	 eight eight eight 
PBmtg269:160	S3:	 eight yeah how many countries we'll have
PBmtg269:161	S1:	 [place6] [place1] [place5] [place7] [place3] and 
PBmtg269:162	S2:	 xxx 
PBmtg269:163	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:164	S3:	 yeah yeah hh that there will be er that agency will come up with one regional concept about centrally develop executional manual for elements which can be done on the level of countries and as this regional concept is to be accepted regionally by the [org4] er then there will be an adaptation of the project on the country level er with the interagreement with local national associations er that the project will be tailored to the needs of three erm three different sizes countries let's say the most important countries like t one will be [place5] er [place8] [place1] the growing number in fourth one then there will be t u two countries and t u three countries and depending on that will be the the project will be bigger or smaller and then there will be one central budget which has to be enough for the whole er program okay now we have this t u countries i have listed just only those who participate in this spring in april starting the project in april so [place5] [place2] [place8] and [place1] is t one countries and t two is [place3] [place7] [place4] and [place9] yeah okay thank you so i have to switch to [org5] presentation actually so so this is the concept which agency finally came with and we have accepted er the concept is clean up your laundry habits hh er okay from the principle of feng shui i will leave it because i think that you have read it before so er why we have agreed on this concept because i think that the next slide gives you all the rationale behind because we are really er the problem was the one which i have mentioned at the beginning how to find the balance good balance er between two key messages which we have one message which is how to educate consumers that they have just dose differently and use different washing habits accept different washing habits on the other hand how to er how to provide general public with some environmental messages is ap- when appropriate if appropriate and how to mix it up everything under one common umbrella so the concept which agency came finally with clean up your laundry habits we thought that it's wide enough broad enough which will allow us to talk about trivial things like er dose thirty-three per cent less and at the other hand also including from the perspective and from the er stakeholders' messages like this will give us some environmental benefits as well so clean up the laundry habits it's it's the concept which gives us the both opportunities we can have a press conferences for er l- light-hearted er woman's media as well as for the general media with the participation of stakeholders having the same umbrella concept and can living with this concept so this was the reason why we have accepted it because we thought that this gives us the flexibility to tailor the message depending on who is talking to whom yeah hh so as it was in a brief agency was thinking about the concept from two perspective one is consumer focus so this communication w- will be more light-hearted er focus more key messages like for consumers like convenience like modern trend and er on the other hand un- under this umbrella will we will incorporate stakeholders' communications which will probably be more focused about er potential environment benefits behind the [thing1] compaction okay core messages us again ag- a- a- again accordingly for the consumers talking about convenience compact [thing1] are convenient less [thing1] are needed for washing er compact [thing1] are the latest step in the evolution of household lan- er household laundry supporting we will switch to more er i don't know how to say to more environmental things like compact [thing1] can help you help the environment less packaging less chemi- chemicals less energy in the process and more like this okay so this is a concept of the p r communication now the question is now we are coming to the point when the question is how many tools we have and what we can do on the country level what are the activities which agency has proposed to be part of the communication or to cons- or to create the communication at the end of the day okay hh first the stakeholder research and dialogue er it was said also in the creative brief which we er you will notice when you will look it through carefully that we have agreed that before we start p r communication we will do on the country level stakeholder campaign we as a national association so we will as a national association approach potential stakeholders who can be our allies er potentially hopefully and also those who can be kind of our enemies or our opponents in this initiatives to understand better who is like to play which role in the when the product is launch to understand the problems to address the potential issues may have hh and also during this proce- process to recognize those who will become our stakeholders' supporters agency called that in the presentation champions so who will be those stakeholders who we will invite to stay er to stand up next to us during the press conference for example saying that this is right thing to do it's has many side benefits for environment for society so let's do this let's help the industry to do this er agency erm basically it was said that agency will not be responsible for this stakeholder campaign so national associations and members of national association should approach the key stakeholders personally and once the champions is recognized the champion is given to the corporate to the agency and to [org5] and [org5] works with the stakeholders then how to involve the stakeholders into the communication er of the p r program hh however it may happen in some countries that er you might need an [org5] support i think in the stakeholders' dialogue and er dankeschoen er in the stakeholder dialogue so er especially is important because [org5] has done er initialed research on the markets trying to understand the potential stakeholders we have in the countries and what they think about the project hh so i think did agency deliver the stakeholder research at the meeting
PBmtg269:165	S4:	 no no 
PBmtg269:166	S7:	 no no 
PBmtg269:167	S3:	 okay i think that [first name6] didn't want didn't want agency to deliver this knowledge personally i have asked my agency in [place1] to deliver their knowledge about potential stakeholders which was er results of the initialled research upon the [place1] er market on this topic so you have probably you can ask agency to come with the n- with the presentation not only the general concept er but also the results of stakeholder campaign stakeholder research they did something like a few months ago 
PBmtg269:168	S5:	 they promised they would send it er presented this first er 
PBmtg269:169	S3:	 okay

PBmtg269:179	S3:	 i mean this was basically the thinking i mean especially for the countries where [org2] is strong because basically [org2] has relations yeah they have many peoples working upon external relations at least in [place1] there is something like that person is doing nothing else but working upon the er stakeholders different kind of stakeholders 
PBmtg269:180	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:181	S3:	 hh so i can assume that they have stakeholder in [place1] so i would really love to rely on the relations already existing relations er they might have but it does has to be the true for every country so it depends so from that perspective i think that in [place1] whatever agency has done at the beginning because they did this research trying to prepare themself for the development of concept i mean to understand what's are the risk on country levels few months ago [org6] did the research on every country so they have some thinking behind they know some persons or er at least organizations and they can share this knowledge whenever is appropriate i don't think that erm i have to need them very desperately and their relations because i have very well developed [org2] @ but er but in the countries where [org2] is not active maybe agency should be will er engage a little bit also in the stakeholder campaign okay
PBmtg269:182	S5:	 but here or in [place3] there were er already on the first meeting some stakeholders er mentioned and er the guy from [org2] already got er had a meeting with the bureau for chemicals
PBmtg269:183	S3:	 you did 
PBmtg269:184	S5:	 under the ministry of health and er 
PBmtg269:185	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:186	S5:	 from [org1] we are visiting the consumer association in [place3] we somehow divided er this 
PBmtg269:187	S3:	 the responsibilities 
PBmtg269:188	S5:	 the responsibilities for already 
PBmtg269:189	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:190	S5:	 known and existing 
PBmtg269:191	S3:	 and who will go to this consumers your r n d guy
PBmtg269:192	S5:	 er no me and marketing er 
PBmtg269:193	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:194	S5:	 woman and er we are promised the [org2] guy will send us the presentation
PBmtg269:195	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:196	S5:	 he he used in in his network 
PBmtg269:197	S3:	 yeah yeah yes 
PBmtg269:198	S5:	 so 
PBmtg269:199	S7:	 j- just a question from my side was it like really that they had to do it in every country this stakeholders research because has told my [place8] agency they didn't know at all that they will had to take part in this project and they were even a- you remember i was writing to you 
PBmtg269:200	S3:	 yeah yeah i remember i mean 
PBmtg269:201	S1:	 mhm that's the [place6] the [org5] he has no 
PBmtg269:202	S3:	 in [place6] [org5] does not exist they were working with an alternative now 
PBmtg269:203	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:204	S7:	 a representative yeah company is not an not an xx 
PBmtg269:205	S1:	 no not new now okay mhm 
PBmtg269:206	S7:	 but li- i mean there's i contacted the agency and they were like they are p a er [org2] agents p r agency and they were like even talking about interest of conflict and being slightly resistant to corporate so they for sure haven't done any researches on that and they didn't know anything about [org4] so this pf 
PBmtg269:207	SX-1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:208	S3:	 i think that the the the point is that 
PBmtg269:209	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:210	S3:	 there was probably a kind of agreement on the top level between [org5] and [org6] to work up on this project whenever it happens
PBmtg269:211	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:212	S3:	 but the negotiations with the [org4] were rather long
PBmtg269:213	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:214	S3:	 but i don't think that they involved 
PBmtg269:215	S1:	
PBmtg269:216	S3:	 er [org1] more into the process 
PBmtg269:217	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:218	S7:	 but 
PBmtg269:219	S3:	 and before this er letter of xx was not signed before we did not accepted the final brief i know that today there is a teleconference [org5] has teleconference with all countries 
PBmtg269:220	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:221	S3:	 er in the project of the spring so i think 
PBmtg269:222	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:223	S1:	 so i think yeah 
PBmtg269:224	S7:	 i know that also the me- the countries have a meeting like [place4] this agency had last week meeting with [org5] like centrally so they are working now but like yet for sure it's not done yet
PBmtg269:225	S3:	 okay
PBmtg269:226	S7:	 like this steps which you talked this is just i wanted to plant there's it 
PBmtg269:227	S3:	 yeah that's 
PBmtg269:228	S3:	 in june i was informed by [first name7] [last name7] who is leader of this project from the [org5] side that 
PBmtg269:229	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:230	S3:	 today he has a teleconference with all countries
PBmtg269:231	S7:	 okay 
PBmtg269:232	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:233	S1:	 aha 
PBmtg269:234	S3:	 to give them the presentation to brief them to talk to whatever yeah
PBmtg269:235	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:236	S3:	 i don't think that they will create er the location to meet all those people together like we could afford i don't th- i wouldn't expect them
PBmtg269:237	S1:	 no 
PBmtg269:238	S3:	 but at least teleconference and er somehow he's responsible whenever it doesn't work i mean they have to be moneyed because as as an agency who received this project because is a network with ac- er across across the region 
PBmtg269:239	S1:	 uhu 
PBmtg269:240	S1:	 uhu 
PBmtg269:241	S3:	 we should really push them to work as a network without having er any 
PBmtg269:242	S7:	 okay 
PBmtg269:243	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:244	S3:	 i mean not accept any apologies or whatever they have to work as a net- network this is the beauty to have them yeah
PBmtg269:245	SX-f:	 hm 
PBmtg269:246	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:247	S3:	 okay hh so er ba- basically again having hhh er talking about the erm all the knowledge it's i- which is behind this project i mean the [org4] and ma- members of [org4] when i talk at [org4] i'm always thinking about the [place13] and the 
PBmtg269:248	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:249	S3:	 the the headquarter when i talk in national association i'm talking about the association in the country just to make you hh understand because we also er always have such a problem hh so [org4] done a great job an- i mean and the and the members of [org4] did a a erm a huge job already thinking about all this scientific aspects of the project thinking about the hh er life cycle analysis thinking about the q and as messages about the legal opinion on the project so all erm potential risk which are how to deal with this risk everything was done at the level of er [org4] without really incorporating [org5] in the process of thinking okay er i think that this was somehow right because because this project er was to be accepted on the [place13] level with the european committee was briefed also on this project and so on so forth it was really really a political thing hhh er so those documents are some of them are completely ready some of them are in the drafts n- nevertheless you will get all of them here in this c ds so you will get everything what is about this project the project description scientific dossier so from the scientific perspective what's going on about this compaction er this xx er memorandum which is very legal f- fifteen pages of legal deliberation behind the project what is legally accepted what can be legal risky and how to deal with this potential issues hh so er i think that also [org5]- we we i have to make sure but i think that we also at the end of the day we share this information with [org5] so [org5] from some perspective and from at certain point should be really able to talk about those problems but only at the country level we decided that if [org5] is going to manage issue management they should use all those documents and communication pattern which was developed within the [org4] and they have to adopt it on the country level only so they were not working yet upon the central q and as and probably they will not work n- n- no one is acce- er expecting them to work upon this regional q and as but in the other hand er there are needs to adapt this those q and as for the er country purposes every single country purposes because of different kind of stakeholders to be engaged in the campaign and so on so forth this is already [org5] responsibility okay so they will warn 
PBmtg269:250	S4:	 so we should develop local ones 
PBmtg269:251	S3:	 sorry
PBmtg269:252	S4:	 we should we should develop local q and as with [org5] together 
PBmtg269:253	S3:	 er y- kind of
PBmtg269:254	S4:	 yes 
PBmtg269:255	S3:	 i mean again there is a ooph like with working with different companies there is erm different thinking behind what q and as are and what are not okay there is a discussion between [org1] and [org2] what are really q and as [org2] position okay is that q and as is more like bunch of information background information about the project
PBmtg269:256	SX-f:	 @
PBmtg269:257	S3:	 okay
PBmtg269:258	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:259	S3:	 okay they are d- difficult questions but the they are not whether that difficult quest- what questions which probably should happened and might happened but the answers behind those questions below are like a library what can be said in this situation not ready-to-go answers they are more like when ooph talking about interviewing communication media training for the case they love to use a document which they call message truck i have those documents for you as well and i will show them to you and it will really depends on you what you would like to use the documents which er 
PBmtg269:260	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:261	S3:	 er [org2] call message truck 
PBmtg269:262	S1:	 we message house @@@@
PBmtg269:263	S3:	 they have we have message er house they call it message truck and message truck is the it's er we will c- we'll come to this or you would like to have more like q and as things hh but the th- both things are really parallel and they like comprehensive to each other so i th- there they should not be in those documents er contradictions internal contradictions but okay er this is something which you have er really digest by your- by yourself i mean i cannot really help you i can provide you those documents that those are drafts er but er then you you with your agency depending on the really characteristic of every country and cultural differences of all that countries and consumers' understanding maybe this q and as have to be done some additional questions ma- may may come like er with this s s- sul- sul- sulfide whatever the things 
PBmtg269:264	S4:	 phosphate 
PBmtg269:265	S4:	 phosphates 
PBmtg269:266	S3:	 phosphates whatever hh er in your countries so er okay so but this is something which we do not probably er discuss on the regional level this is something which is to be done on the country level
PBmtg269:267	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg269:268	S3:	 okay hh so stakeholder press pack er yeah they call it stakeholder press pack they call it press pack which will go er together with the to to a co- well a company er press briefing for general media with the participation of stakeholder who will support and saying this is right thing to do okay hh so [org5] regionally will develop kind of press pack a blueprint like a masterpiece to be adapted on the country level so you will get something and based of this you will have to develop your own press m- press kit press materials okay
PBmtg269:269	S3:	 things which okay agency is thinking that we should do the same thing across different countries er like er to do then a survey how consumers behave er how they are the washing habits but in more light-hearted way something which is proper for the communication for woman's media hh and but try to collect to get a data the same data from different markets from different countries so to make this way to make it very attractive for media and to sell it as a news and behind this news by the way thirty-three compaction it's coming thirty-three per cent comp- compaction is coming so this is n- agency er general idea we didn't see any execution any erm i mean er yeah okay very general question as you can see if you can clean up er one area of your life what would it be i mean they go really into very light-hearted things personally i d- don't really understand the beauty of it i think that we have to wait for the execution and and more specific proposal of the agency the beauty is for sure that this is a unique occasion to have er a data which can erm compare our consumers in different countries okay but the question is which questions will be asked and how credible how for which money @@
PBmtg269:270	S4:	 how yeah 
PBmtg269:271	S4:	 and yeah 
PBmtg269:272	S3:	 er so it won't be for sure xxx or whatever so er because it's too expensive 
PBmtg269:273	S1:	 no 
PBmtg269:274	S3:	 so the question is how we can really how whether this th- th- this this this data will be really really very very very attractive we'll see okay the issue management good things about is that agency er within the agency f- fee all potential issue management's things are included so whatever it happens from agency is to work with and support us with the issue management without additional er remuneration without the additional agency fee so er hopefully it won't be necessary but if w- we just have it within the fee agency fee hh er i mention because it wasn't that obvious at the very beginning of the discussion with [org5] so this is one of the successes of negotiations that we've got they support just for free whenever it's appropriate and this as we sai- as us as us er as i said at the level of [org4] this regional level the biggest documents communication documents like message truck if you like like q and as like scientific dossier like l- legal erm er like legal er description of the project and so on so forth those documents were developed and are ready more or less some of them more some of them less however on the basis of country how to tackle with this every single issue which com- which might come this is responsibility of er [org5] to take care for on the country level and to deliver and provide us with the er substantial support in any issue management which may happened okay so this is it so hhh having said that there was an intent of like letter of intent signed between er [org4] and [org5] on the regional level which says that er er agreed scope of activities for a t one country so this biggest countries which is [place1] [place5] [place8] and i have forgotten hh er like you have here yeah and [place2] of course is 
PBmtg269:275	SX-f:	 ah 
PBmtg269:276	S3:	 press conference briefing for general media er three press releases altogether for national trade and consumer media two interviews with [org4] or with any stakeholders if appropriate so agency is responsible to to have to place one or two interviews er [org5] will identify role model and use it appropriately erm through the communication to to to to the media and general public hh er consumer press briefing with role model if appropriate will happened two to three interviews with role model will be placed media house partnership will happened attitudinal survey will happened local expert opinion piece thinking sociologist or psychologist if the results results of atti- attitudinal survey are to be somehow supported or somehow erm explain to general public we will need someone who will say about it so er it cannot be us it has to be some expert a psychologist or sociologist this is er all about 
PBmtg269:277	S4:	 is this local expert it's local expert it's just a 
PBmtg269:278	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:279	S4:	 psychologist 
PBmtg269:280	S3:	 this is psychologist or sociologist to give an an opinion on the results of attitudinal survey as as appropriated 
PBmtg269:281	S4:	 aha so it's correlated 
PBmtg269:282	S3:	 this is correlated one to each other and on buying issue management okay so this is corporate activities for t one countries
PBmtg269:283	S7:	 how did you specifically come up with this split of the countries because for [place6] it's like that one country is 
PBmtg269:284	S1:	 genau 
PBmtg269:285	S1:	 [place8] 
PBmtg269:286	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg269:287	S7:	 is t one and the second one two other are in t two 
PBmtg269:288	S1:	 i mean 
PBmtg269:289	S3:	 this was decided by the erm train and marketing task force at the regional level i think 
PBmtg269:290	S1:	 quite strange yeah 
PBmtg269:291	S7:	 but regional level you mean what is regional level like locally or 
PBmtg269:292	S3:	 i mean the the task force like there are [first name3] [last name3] from [org2] 
PBmtg269:293	S7:	 i mean i'm glad for it because this is the first time like it's really the case than [place6] is divided the first time this is the reason i am 
PBmtg269:294	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:295	S3:	 er i mean because it was 
PBmtg269:296	S1:	 hm
PBmtg269:297	S3:	 i'm not sure whether it was not also suggested by the agency that [place8] is especially sensitive of the environmental things
PBmtg269:298	S7:	 they are more sensitive they are more sensitive 
PBmtg269:299	S3:	 more than more than any other [place6] countries that's why although not because of the size but because of this environmental 
PBmtg269:300	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:301	S3:	 hh issues which are a xx host 
PBmtg269:302	S7:	 in general sensitive as yeah you could be right
PBmtg269:303	S3:	 that's why the [place8] was was
PBmtg269:304	S7:	 our compensation 
PBmtg269:305	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:306	S3:	 was positioned like i mean separately 
PBmtg269:307	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:308	S3:	 and er out versus the rest of the countries okay t two [place7] [place9] [place4] [place3] it was agreed that that will be press conference er press release er for that general media interviews with [org4] or er stakeholder representative and issue management so not too much 
PBmtg269:309	S6:	 consumer role normal xx 
PBmtg269:310	S3:	 nah 
PBmtg269:311	S7:	 xx 
PBmtg269:312	S3:	 no 
PBmtg269:313	S7:	 no 
PBmtg269:314	S3:	 no hh er because of the money basically 
PBmtg269:315	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:316	S3:	 okay we'll come to the budget in a minute t three was will be just covered with the press releases and issue management if appropriate okay
PBmtg269:317	S1:	 t three are [place10] [place11] [place12] 
PBmtg269:318	S3:	 those country er don't know when will happen the xx [place11] was i i don't remember exactly but some of the countries are again t one
PBmtg269:319	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:320	S3:	 okay i er [place12] for sure is t one was recommenced 
PBmtg269:321	S1:	 is t one
PBmtg269:322	S3:	 [place12] was recommenced as t one 
PBmtg269:323	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:324	S3:	 [place11] i think as well i'm not sure but we should to i can check okay we'll check it together 
PBmtg269:325	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:326	S3:	 where's the letter of intent 
PBmtg269:327	S1:	 they know the information they rather pollute 
PBmtg269:328	S3:	 ah yeah there is the letter of intent for sh- okay 
PBmtg269:329	S1:	 [place1] und [place2] 
PBmtg269:330	S3:	 this is spring the latest xx [place10] [place12] were t one [place11] was t two 
PBmtg269:331	S1:	 okay in the next in september okay
PBmtg269:332	S3:	 yeah and somewhere somewhere and no one knows exactly 
PBmtg269:333	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:334	S1:	 er so okay because i didn't invite er them here 
PBmtg269:335	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg269:336	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:337	S1:	 but it's okay 
PBmtg269:338	S3:	 yeah because it's it's it's it will start in september
PBmtg269:339	S1:	 it's done in september 
PBmtg269:340	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:341	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:342	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:343	S3:	 and that's it from the presentation of [org5] yeah okay something like that any questions comments mhm no
PBmtg269:344	S4:	 are we going back to er what are the next er the next parts of the presentation because i i may have some questions but i'm not hh sure maybe you will talk about it later on so 
PBmtg269:345	S3:	 it's occasional yeah but 
PBmtg269:346	S4:	 erm i mean my basic hh er my basic thing is that i don't know where is er the end of let's say mandatory arguments and where is the beginning of what we can er up- update or adapt er locally
PBmtg269:347	S3:	 mandatory 
PBmtg269:348	S4:	 because er sometimes it can be in a in con- in a contradiction 
PBmtg269:349	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:350	S4:	 with what is what is really decided we cannot say a different way so that we will get er the press releases and some some 
PBmtg269:351	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:352	S4:	 q and as or some things from questions and ans- possible answers hh but er 
PBmtg269:353	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:354	S4:	 the question is how how much we can change it what is the level of er our creativity on the local level it can
PBmtg269:355	S3:	 i mean okay
PBmtg269:356	S4:	 put in 
PBmtg269:357	S3:	 at at the end of the day the objective is not to generate any risk on the country level so i would say that whenever it appropriate to change q and as or to change the answer because for the country it will be better 
PBmtg269:358	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:359	S3:	 i would change it i mean just mind that we 
PBmtg269:360	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg269:361	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg269:362	S3:	 cannot speak on as a company that we have to talk as an association that we should convey the message of thir- thirty-three per cent 
PBmtg269:363	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:364	S3:	 as the primary message for us 
PBmtg269:365	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:366	S3:	 that we can also mention by the way environment but we as a [thing1] company are not very credible talking about environmental production and er from the perspective of [thing1] 
PBmtg269:367	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:368	S2:	 so we can say that er w- we are trying to be to provide less impact to the environment via this project but if then is er necessary to adapt because the situation i mean it really forces to i would say this is 
PBmtg269:369	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:370	S3:	 our responsibility from the country just to act appropriately to the situation well i wouldn't be i mean okay q and as q and as who did q and as q and as did [first name6] and me ha ha @ so

PBmtg269:374	S3:	 i mean er even in some cases when you will look via through our q and as there are sometimes two options of answers because [first name6] was very much er convinced that he is right and i had different proposal how the answers should be should be answered so there are already some

PBmtg269:399	S7:	 uhu 
PBmtg269:400	S3:	 er in q and as and w- we are trying to answer that this is basically has nothing to do but basically it is everything together this is the same digression of getting of achieving more sustainable er sustainable washing or er 
PBmtg269:401	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:402	S3:	 more sustainable industry er this is all about so this is like another proposal another er another er activity which is not interdependent but it's next to yeah nothing i mean whether it's okay coming to the budget budget is hh er three hundred thousand across the europe this is a budget which agency er [org5] will get er for the project majority of money is to be paid in january still in at the end of january a huge amount of money is to be paid still at the end of january so whenever our costs connected to the project agency is to be asked to think about the costs because agency got already money there is no intention to pay anything on the top from our country budgets to the project because the projects is to be done within that budget which is to be managed by the agency who got already the money so if any questions like 
PBmtg269:403	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:404	S3:	 travel costs and whatever agency of course
PBmtg269:405	S4:	 so we can't even save money
PBmtg269:406	S3:	 okay
PBmtg269:407	S4:	 over sometime if we skip some of the er activities we can't save it because it's already paid
PBmtg269:408	S3:	 this is really tough questions @
PBmtg269:409	S4:	 ah i guess it's true right @@
PBmtg269:410	S3:	 this is a really tough question yeah okay this sentence i mean er because okay i also okay let's maybe start with the second slide there is a split which is er in the letter of intent how much is agency fee and how much is executional costs on the country level okay however this contract was er negotiated basically er 
PBmtg269:411	S3:	 if for the sake and for the
PBmtg269:412	SX-f:	 hm 
PBmtg269:413	S3:	 for the quality of the project which will not happened 
PBmtg269:414	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:415	S3:	 so personally i would not rely on it okay er so we will have to live with this budget or i don't know what
PBmtg269:416	S4:	 erm this is also together with the er external fee or or external costs for this erm survey
PBmtg269:417	S1:	 no i don- 
PBmtg269:418	S4:	 for this survey or 
PBmtg269:419	S3:	 yeah erm i mean the the the ooph even 
PBmtg269:420	S4:	 i haven't 
PBmtg269:421	S3:	 er even erm erm okay before the letter of intent because we started with the er i mean be very honest the agency we started talking with the agency from the list of activities till this menu which was set this menu was the price for every single element was proposed by the agency so and it was said that p r er er erm so media briefing will cost agency fee of two thousand and a half thousand then something attitudinal survey will cost agency fee of four thousand euro hh that er er media house partnership arranging media house er that publishing house partnership will er cost agency fee three thousand euro something like that hh but somewhere during the process of the the okay and when started with this agency proposal we ended up with the agency fee which consumed all total budget for the project okay so then it was negotiated that the agency fee will totalled something like two hundred twenty thousand eighty thousand was saved for the execution and this is the results of this negotiations so somewhere in between erm i was discouraged to talk back about how much of agency fee for every given afford of the agency because it will ruin what was negotiated okay and i don't know the risk is only like that that at the end of the day agency will say that the budget of eight thousand eight hundred is finished and you can do nothing 
PBmtg269:422	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:423	S3:	 but our fee is our fee and thank you very much dear [org1] [org2] and whatever okay
PBmtg269:424	S4:	 ooph 
PBmtg269:425	S3:	 which probably happens i don- i'm not going to be very optimistic i think that t two and t three countries are save because in t- er t three countries there's nothing to happen basically in t two countries whatever is happens this four and a half thousand euro will 
PBmtg269:426	S1:	 ts 
PBmtg269:427	S3:	 cover the costs i think so 
PBmtg269:428	S7:	 it's er 
PBmtg269:429	S1:	 yeah sorry but who decided this it's for me it's crazy
PBmtg269:430	S3:	 er er the truth was we could accept this or we could go country by country with the agency and [first name3] and [first name9] were afraid to
PBmtg269:431	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:432	S3:	 okay they were afraid to go without the agency we have to accept this or we would be without it when is is is the the last letter of intent was signed when er between christmas and new year eve 
PBmtg269:433	S1:	 okay
PBmtg269:434	S3:	 okay
PBmtg269:435	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:436	S3:	 till the very end on thursday before christmas 
PBmtg269:437	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:438	S3:	 we had still discussion with the agency and negotiation with the agency
PBmtg269:439	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:440	S1:	 with agency yeah mhm 
PBmtg269:441	S3:	 so they were keeping our suggest to the very very end and the guys were afraid 
PBmtg269:442	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:443	S3:	 to give up the agency so we had at the end of the day we had to accept it i mean i would shoot the agency for that because i think that we are on the lost position we cannot negotiate any penny from the agency
PBmtg269:444	S1:	 do you think it should make sense to then speak with their mother house with personal xx in this case
PBmtg269:445	S3:	 ooph i mean this contract is still not signed
PBmtg269:446	S1:	 because they 
PBmtg269:447	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:448	S3:	 contract is still not signed
PBmtg269:449	S1:	 because [org7] is our global agency and hh it the i know this project is not a [org1] project but i think we er 
PBmtg269:450	S3:	 i mean it's 
PBmtg269:451	S1:	 s- suggested the agency and maybe we can 
PBmtg269:452	S3:	 i mean that [org2] is somewhere in between there where this g- i mean 
PBmtg269:453	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:454	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:455	S3:	 no one will er accused us that it was us who give [org5] because [org2] er somewhere in between 
PBmtg269:456	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:457	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:458	S3:	 we've been thinking about er maybe more creative ideas from other companies we've been thinking about maybe do you know any other er network of the agency who we could be 
PBmtg269:459	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:460	S3:	 i mean er p- pitched between [org5] and maybe someone yeah 
PBmtg269:461	S1:	 the question was the that there's a network
PBmtg269:462	S3:	 i thi- they had no ideas
PBmtg269:463	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:464	S3:	 [org2] has asked they had no ideas
PBmtg269:465	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:466	S3:	 so no one will sue us that it was us who proposed [org5] no one remembered this okay
PBmtg269:467	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:468	S3:	 the point is that the budget wa- is spent basically for the agency fee because if they start to negoti- if they receive a budget like three hundred thousand 
PBmtg269:469	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:470	S3:	 and come up with the first proposals which consume all the budget that's for the agency fee so whatever is negotiated it's okay so we end up with the agency fee at the level of two thousand twenty er two th- er two hundred twenty thousand
PBmtg269:471	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:472	S3:	 eighty thousand for the executional costs which is pf so now what we can do it's add money from the country budgets okay if several companies will er give something i think that maybe this is way because at the end of the day how we can equip the budget on the on the central level i think that this is what really agency thinks about because at the end of the day there are only 
PBmtg269:473	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:474	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:475	S3:	 four or maybe this eight one hundred sixty one countries now
PBmtg269:476	S1:	 erm 
PBmtg269:477	S3:	 the three
PBmtg269:478	S1:	 yeah seven 
PBmtg269:479	S3:	 no one point 
PBmtg269:480	S1:	 i thought t one 
PBmtg269:481	S3:	 no no no no no no but now at this one two three four 
PBmtg269:482	S1:	 yeah the first 
PBmtg269:483	S3:	 five six er the and six
PBmtg269:484	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:485	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:486	S3:	 six okay six so maybe if we could add something like five five hundr- er five erm er fifty thousand another fifty thousand into the project er there will be money for the execution agency will be very healthy with the agency fee and whatever yeah or th- and at the end of the day agency will be very healthy it will x have more xxx
PBmtg269:487	S1:	 how does it work for the marketing campaign 
PBmtg269:488	S3:	 marketing campaign is something different because er there were just only er money for the er 
PBmtg269:489	S1:	 they are xxx 
PBmtg269:490	S3:	 central money was just only for advertising development then country has to split the costs according to the share of what is the market share from the marketing budgets of every single country
PBmtg269:491	S1:	 and for the 
PBmtg269:492	S1:	 mhm
PBmtg269:493	S3:	 so there is not central budget for the marketing things at the regional level just only for p r
PBmtg269:494	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:495	S6:	 [S3] who is the person for example in [place5] who knows all the details of er this agreement er with [org5] 
PBmtg269:496	S3:	 i don't know you will be the only one probably or maybe [org2] will brief the persons 
PBmtg269:497	SX:	 @
PBmtg269:498	S6:	 no 
PBmtg269:499	S6:	 no i'm not maybe maybe [org2] is projected there in [place5] i i i wasn't involved yet
PBmtg269:500	S3:	 you don't know 
PBmtg269:501	S6:	 so i i know that from [org2] xxxxx 
PBmtg269:502	S3:	 it depends how [org2] i mean from [org2] also i mean it was the s- the same story it was said er [first name6] from [place3] [place3] who was working about this project from the [org2] side from the very beginning on our side for the corporate communication from our side was [first name8] i joined in october or something they were active few months n- earlier okay because the agency i joined at the end of october hhh er agency was briefed already in september or or not or 
PBmtg269:503	S1:	 in september yes 
PBmtg269:504	S3:	 in september the beginning of september 
PBmtg269:505	S1:	 in august were the pitch there were the first pitch in in in brussels
PBmtg269:506	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:507	S1:	 and in september was then a concrete briefing
PBmtg269:508	S6:	 and who is the project leader the general who
PBmtg269:509	S3:	 er of other but of what 
PBmtg269:510	S1:	 by [org1] 
PBmtg269:511	S3:	 for [org1] 
PBmtg269:512	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:513	S3:	 [first name9] is er pro- pro- er is er leader 
PBmtg269:514	S1:	 no 
PBmtg269:515	S6:	 and is he 
PBmtg269:516	S3:	 [first name9] is the leader of the project i wa- i joined just only for corporate communication things 
PBmtg269:517	S1:	 for 
PBmtg269:518	S1:	 p r 
PBmtg269:519	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:520	S3:	 but from [org1] at the very beginning it was [first name8] 
PBmtg269:521	S1:	 mhm [first name8] 
PBmtg269:522	S3:	 from the very beginning [first name8] was from the very beginning and basically i think that from our side she is the leader of the corporate communication but really hh negotiation was er paying nowhere
PBmtg269:523	S6:	 it seems quite chaotic
PBmtg269:524	SX-1:	 @
PBmtg269:525	S3:	 what
PBmtg269:526	S6:	 it seems to be the s- the situation a bit chaotic nobody knows 
PBmtg269:527	S3:	 it is
PBmtg269:528	S6:	 yes 
PBmtg269:529	S3:	 i mean er everybody's knows but there is no i do- i don't know how to say i mean agency was very clever i mean agency 
PBmtg269:530	S6:	 it was clever and the agency there is xxxx 
PBmtg269:531	S3:	 agency was very clever in this situation i mean 
PBmtg269:532	S6:	 the agency will steer this this project
PBmtg269:533	S3:	 sorry
PBmtg269:534	S6:	 the agency will steer this project
PBmtg269:535	S3:	 an- er this is the beauty of this yeah
PBmtg269:536	S6:	 but 
PBmtg269:537	S3:	 so we er 
PBmtg269:538	S1:	 i think it's not a disadvantage because i think it's very difficult to steer between companies
PBmtg269:539	S6:	 yes 
PBmtg269:540	S1:	 so there's [org1] there's [org2] we are a com- this is the competition normally and i know [org4] they are working together but hh i think we need a neutral 
PBmtg269:541	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:542	S3:	 and the company it's 
PBmtg269:543	S1:	 partner
PBmtg269:544	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:545	S1:	 we need it yeah
PBmtg269:546	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg269:547	S6:	 yes but er we we need it to have erm to know er what are what are the agreed er main tasks of the agency what are the obligations of the agency and what are our obligations who knows 
PBmtg269:548	S1:	 no this is clear 
PBmtg269:549	S3:	 what do you mean with the obligations

PBmtg269:553	S3:	 i mean that's th- er ooph
PBmtg269:554	S4:	 do you have a working group this p r working group 
PBmtg269:555	S6:	 no 
PBmtg269:556	S4:	 should be at er your national association
PBmtg269:557	S3:	 maybe
PBmtg269:558	S5:	 maybe 
PBmtg269:559	S6:	 maybe i don't know anything about it
PBmtg269:560	S5:	 someone from your r n d department sh- should know of it know about it 
PBmtg269:561	S6:	 how xx can be there and and r n d you know can be a part of part of the xxx per cent of the e u and with the national association 
PBmtg269:562	S1:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg269:563	SX-3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:564	S4:	 they should form also that they should form the the p r group as well
PBmtg269:565	SX-f:	 this is the 
PBmtg269:566	S4:	 no
PBmtg269:567	S1:	 maybe has to ask her
PBmtg269:568	S7:	 if if this if [org5] doesn't have a 
PBmtg269:569	S1:	 xxxx 
PBmtg269:570	S7:	 representative like official presenting the [place6] can we change companies because a very first thing that we check out from the yeah from asking is that they are extremely expensive and nothing cr- nothing good @@ so like can we somehow affect this choice of the representative company if th- if they don't have it like this 
PBmtg269:571	S1:	 no 
PBmtg269:572	S7:	 officially always set representative company or this is clearly [org5]'s choice whom they are choosing 
PBmtg269:573	S3:	 i mean this is [org5] choice
PBmtg269:574	S7:	 and we can no way affect it
PBmtg269:575	S3:	 hhh 
PBmtg269:576	S7:	 if they don't have it like er really there like [org1] has [org1] like you know this this kind of choice xxxxxx 
PBmtg269:577	S3:	 yeah i mean [org5] promised us to have a network across all countries promised to work within tha- tha- that ne- network i don't know 
PBmtg269:578	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:579	S3:	 i mean in [place1] there is [org5] in [place2] in [place5] there is [org5] offices like this
PBmtg269:580	S7:	 yeah we don't have this is the reason i'm like like maybe there could be waked u- way out to some other because we had represesentative a very good agency [org8] p r agency 
PBmtg269:581	S1:	 yeah erm [org8] would be also our partner now for corporate communication i have a meeting end of january with with 
PBmtg269:582	S7:	 so maybe we can use them instead of this 
PBmtg269:583	S1:	 er it's not [org8] it's another er maybe it's [org8] 
PBmtg269:584	S7:	 but it's under [org9] basically you know
PBmtg269:585	S1:	 no ooph 
PBmtg269:586	S7:	 not under but together 
PBmtg269:587	S1:	 it's another c- er we sear- we are searching for a agency for [place6] 
PBmtg269:588	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:589	S1:	 and our need is that the the agency can work in all three countries together
PBmtg269:590	S7:	 but [org8] could because they are working with representatives in all three countries and they were very successful in all three countries 
PBmtg269:591	S1:	 then it is [org8] one er i will have a meeting end of january with [first name10] and with all the 
PBmtg269:592	S7:	 uhu 
PBmtg269:593	S1:	 yeah with the agency for us for [org1] but maybe 
PBmtg269:594	S7:	 for [org1] but this is for future but er what about this [org4] maybe then 
PBmtg269:595	S1:	 the question is this agency has to be connected to our network xxxxx [org5] the question could be if this agency can work also for the [org4] project this is the question yeah mhm 
PBmtg269:596	S7:	 can be that yeah okay
PBmtg269:597	S7:	 yeah exactly 
PBmtg269:598	S7:	 maybe we can s- hopefully find it out whom we should address because it would be more easy to work 
PBmtg269:599	S1:	 i can check this i can ask er 
PBmtg269:600	S3:	 [first name7] [first name7] [last name7] 
PBmtg269:601	S1:	 [first name7] 
PBmtg269:602	S1:	 [first name7] first to say that we will work there with this agency and not with their 
PBmtg269:603	S3:	 er can you write down me the agency which you like to we can xxxxxxxx 
PBmtg269:604	S1:	 but i will send it to you i'm not sure if it's [org8] if i have to check this in my email cos [first name10] first sorry yeah first [first name10] er suggested it and then sie she checked it they are not possible to work in three countries but 
PBmtg269:605	S7:	 i will just go between it the the between struggle 
PBmtg269:606	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:607	S3:	 okay coming back agency what should happen now agency should come with the proposal how to make this project er on a xx level on the country levels what they propose to make for the country country
PBmtg269:608	S6:	 this are this are the agency's er obligations these standpoints 
PBmtg269:609	S3:	 i mean those are only those are points for er t one countries yes
PBmtg269:610	S6:	 yes
PBmtg269:611	S3:	 and they should come with the proposal for the money they have what they propose to do with whom how and what are and so so forth okay er once again wishful thinking of [first name3] [last name3] when negotiating was that no matter how much it will cost agency will do all points which were negotiated okay
PBmtg269:612	S4:	 is it in the contract for them
PBmtg269:613	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:614	S3:	 the contract is not realistic yet
PBmtg269:615	S4:	 mhm hm 
PBmtg269:616	S3:	 today the guy who is supposed to make the contract will come back from i addressed this my my concern that it will not happen that agency will not give up any part of the agency fee for the sake of xxx of execution i addressed to [first name3] [last name3] and he said don't worry we will try to er make it more clear in the contract to make it more understandable for [org5] that more important is not the split which you have here but the split erm which was in the erm agency presentation what is obligatory mandatory for t one country from the agency is supposed to deliver all t one country elements of the program not thinking about the money
PBmtg269:617	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:618	S3:	 this is wishful thinking on our side what how it will end up i'm not sure i'm very worried that agency signed that for eight thousand eight hundred money because our celebrity will cost you four thousand
PBmtg269:619	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:620	S3:	 er one press conference will t- cost you another three thousand you have one thousand left for which we can do pf and this will be end of the story
PBmtg269:621	S4:	 er i don't want a celebrity
PBmtg269:622	S3:	 you don't want celebrity 
PBmtg269:623	S4:	 yeah because i don't it's not effective
PBmtg269:624	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:625	S4:	 in my country 
PBmtg269:626	S1:	 @
PBmtg269:627	S3:	 in our country okay when i talked to another agency agency said that celebrities i mean it's out of date this doesn't work any more 
PBmtg269:628	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:629	S3:	 and not for sure in [place1] are not credible they would not suggest to do so so 
PBmtg269:630	S4:	 yes to have but xxxxxxx 
PBmtg269:631	S1:	 [first name11] [first name11] @@@@@@@@@ die [first name11] [last name11] 
PBmtg269:632	S4:	 we tried this with the [thing2] girl you know 
PBmtg269:633	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:634	S4:	 er deep into the water and this 
PBmtg269:635	S1:	 the south african

PBmtg269:640	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:641	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:642	S1:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg269:643	S3:	 so erm

PBmtg269:645	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:646	S3:	 hm so okay so if we still are not sure how to win the four hundred thousand for the celebrity right
PBmtg269:647	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:648	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg269:649	S4:	 er but i i read somewhere in in the brief that er p r campaign should er should start like one month before and not three is it 
PBmtg269:650	S3:	 nah nah no 
PBmtg269:651	S4:	 is it within is the timing within the budget is it said like er 
PBmtg269:652	S3:	 erm okay so another erm painful things which er is not in the presentation 
PBmtg269:653	S1:	 we should ask if 
PBmtg269:654	S3:	 which is not 
PBmtg269:655	S1:	 the controlling @@@
PBmtg269:656	S3:	 not in the presentation so er when erm
PBmtg269:657	S1:	 because it 
PBmtg269:658	S3:	 final presentation for [org5] came there was erm c p s over the x of schedule so when needs to be done what and till when
PBmtg269:659	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:660	S3:	 ended up started something like in january and ended at the end of april okay so i'm supposed to have on tuesday erm tomorrow meeting with [first name7] i'm going to ask him that we will switch again according to the creative brief so agency will start working i mean the execution of the program will agency will not start working but execution of the program program is to be launched one month before and
PBmtg269:661	S7:	 no er i cannot reach and i'll get back to the other's meeting because [first name7] is out of office 
PBmtg269:662	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:663	S7:	 [place8] office 
PBmtg269:664	S3:	 mhm mhm we'll think about it so the p r program will start one month before and will end till mid- -june i hope at least i hope yeah for the period of three months but don't think that this is anything we can do 
PBmtg269:665	S4:	 but within these three months or four months or whatever they have to fill in these er 
PBmtg269:666	S3:	 yeah those this elements
PBmtg269:667	S4:	 er 
PBmtg269:668	S4:	 but if they don't they have to deliver it in july august september they have to i guess 
PBmtg269:669	S3:	 tough question i don't know
PBmtg269:670	S4:	 or in in in in other words erm i guess i'll have to check how good is the relationship between the [org5] erm agencies in the countries because i can go to to our agency or [org5] and would say just you have to do this no matter when or 
PBmtg269:671	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:672	S4:	 better sooner the better but you you won- it is agreed that you do this this this and that and then i'll wait if they come after me to 
PBmtg269:673	S3:	 yeah but they 
PBmtg269:674	S4:	 er be- er beckon and say oh-oh this is not agreed
PBmtg269:675	S3:	 i mean what i would propose 
PBmtg269:676	S4:	 can or cannot i propose 
PBmtg269:677	S3:	 yeah but what i would propose i would try to push for all elements to be executed which agr- which a- which agreed
PBmtg269:678	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:679	S3:	 and look what happened and see what happened this is also what i'm going to 
PBmtg269:680	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:681	S3:	 that in the letter of intent is said that those things are happened
PBmtg269:682	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:683	S3:	 and we will said whether [first name3] [last name3] very optimistic was right or me and [S1] are right that it won't happened as 
PBmtg269:684	S1:	 @@
PBmtg269:685	S3:	 as [first name3] [last name3] thinks that it will happen okay so er i would try to push the agency and er look what happened the feedback is important in the meantime we w- we should sign the contract and i hope that in the contract should be something more specific specific said going into the direction that no matter what agency will deliver the quality what was and all the points which were agreed okay because at the end of the day just only a few countries which are really tough here in this game erm so by the time being i would push agency for everything to happened
PBmtg269:686	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:687	S3:	 within three months or whatever doesn't really matter
PBmtg269:688	S4:	 but they start to work now
PBmtg269:689	S3:	 erm yes they are they are supposed to come for the meetings okay no maybe not yes i think that with er this week or next week we should have at the national associations meeting with the agency er invited the agency at least like it happened in [place3] how it was 
PBmtg269:690	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:691	S3:	 agency came
PBmtg269:692	S5:	 of course 
PBmtg269:693	S3:	 with the presentation which i have shown
PBmtg269:694	S5:	 maybe wasn't mentioned yeah the same one yeah 
PBmtg269:695	S3:	 there was any feedback from the national association from the members from other companies 
PBmtg269:696	S5:	 actually there were some topics er we discussed about who will erm come up with a press conference who is going to to be the hostman of the press conference so there were some topics on where is the red link er with p r and advertising together with this label will it be also in p r market concept we w- we were having some some discussion on this er special topics yeah 
PBmtg269:697	S3:	 but not yet er about the stakeholders 
PBmtg269:698	S5:	 not 
PBmtg269:699	S5:	 no
PBmtg269:700	S3:	 not yet and what was the next 
PBmtg269:701	S5:	 no
PBmtg269:702	S5:	 that was er 
PBmtg269:703	S3:	 and what was agreed that agency will come back and what they will come back and have kind of in their presentation within two weeks 
PBmtg269:704	S5:	 the the specific [place3] media yeah 
PBmtg269:705	S3:	 three weeks when
PBmtg269:706	S5:	 erm we are having the next meeting on tw- twenty-third of january until then we should have also the information on the er discovering of the stake- stakeholders er non-governmental organizations er mostly because these governmental organizations are here and we are al- already doing this over er mister [last name6] was 
PBmtg269:707	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:708	S5:	 that er one year already we are going to speak 
PBmtg269:709	S3:	 you are going to the s- consumer mhm 
PBmtg269:710	S5:	 er or yeah or i i would er want to ask for the presentation so i c- i can compare it with er [org2] guys one 
PBmtg269:711	S3:	 no but this is ju- only one presentation
PBmtg269:712	S5:	 the only presentation there is okay 
PBmtg269:713	S3:	 this is the only one presentation so all documents are ass- are assured the q and as which you have i have received on thursday from [first name6] [last name6] so 
PBmtg269:714	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:715	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg269:716	S3:	 everything what is circulating
PBmtg269:717	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:718	S3:	 assuming that this is very last version is common between all er at least [org1] and [org2] 
PBmtg269:719	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg269:720	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:721	S5:	 one more question er before erm we had a presentation of mister [last name12] and he told us if i understa- understood him correctly that er laundry sustainability project must not be linked with compacting and er this working group has er erm named this er project like er direct translation er compacting [thing1] project so it must not be named like project of com- 
PBmtg269:722	S4:	 we can't na- 
PBmtg269:723	S5:	 compacting 
PBmtg269:724	S4:	 we can't name it sustainability and we can't name it compact so how we should name it @@@@
PBmtg269:725	S5:	 so
PBmtg269:726	S5:	 i have here this problem because when i'm going out to this organization i i have to present it in [place3] language
PBmtg269:727	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:728	S5:	 i i believe we should avoid this compacting word compact word or 
PBmtg269:729	S2:	 @@@
PBmtg269:730	S4:	 maybe we also have to avoid sustainability 
PBmtg269:731	S1:	 i think also sustainability's m- more positive 
PBmtg269:732	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:733	S1:	 i think it's more logical
PBmtg269:734	S4:	 it is but we can't do it because it is environmental and we can't do it 
PBmtg269:735	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:736	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:737	S4:	 practically so we 
PBmtg269:738	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:739	S3:	 erm 
PBmtg269:740	S4:	 all the project documentation is named [org4] sustain ability or [thing3] sustainability project
PBmtg269:741	S3:	 sustainability 
PBmtg269:742	S1:	 sustainability 
PBmtg269:743	S3:	 politically correct is talking about sustainability er there were of course discussions also at level of construction of the concept of the project whether it's er necessary to talk about sustainability especially that in our c- er i mean the sustainability concept is not very popular among not only western europeans but also in the eastern eur- even less popular among eastern europeans so whether sustainability really means anything to anybody in our countries the bottom line is that not but this is politically correct yeah so er so th- everybody decided to be on the level of sustainability sustainability is politically correct th- this is one of the project which erm is still popular is the sustainability concept as such we should not talk about compaction
PBmtg269:744	S5:	
PBmtg269:745	S3:	 no
PBmtg269:746	S5:	 er if i understood er 
PBmtg269:747	S4:	 xxxx told us 
PBmtg269:748	S5:	 correctly
PBmtg269:749	S4:	 [first name9] said something about 
PBmtg269:750	S5:	 yes because compaction has er something to do with the producers you know and we are 
PBmtg269:751	SX-6:	 we wanted er to go from the industry 
PBmtg269:752	S4:	 it can give also the supercompact 
PBmtg269:753	S1:	 go to the consumer 
PBmtg269:754	S5:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:755	S4:	 which we don't want to which failed in some countries try we tried so for examples in supercompacts like [thing4] and stuff some tablets in er nineteen 
PBmtg269:756	S5:	 yes yeah 
PBmtg269:757	S4:	 but it failed 
PBmtg269:758	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:759	S4:	 and er if we talk directly about compacts it can involve thinking about these
PBmtg269:760	SX-3:	 hh so what then we have to talk about 
PBmtg269:761	S4:	 which is not 
PBmtg269:762	S1:	 @@
PBmtg269:763	S3:	 any ideas because i don't know that no i don't know 
PBmtg269:764	S4:	 dosing @
PBmtg269:765	S3:	 about dosing no it's it's 
PBmtg269:766	S4:	 convenience of dosing i don't know 
PBmtg269:767	S6:	 but i have problems with the core messages because i think it's er are similar to
PBmtg269:768	S3:	 what
PBmtg269:769	S6:	 that er er the first core message is that compact [thing1] are the latest step in the evolution of household laundry i cannot be true simply 
PBmtg269:770	S3:	 mhm
PBmtg269:771	S6:	 because evolution is not finished in case of compacts 
PBmtg269:772	S1:	 yeah and it and it it is for me it is also not a key message yeah 
PBmtg269:773	SX-f:	 xxxxxxxx 
PBmtg269:774	S6:	 cannot be true it cannot be core message 
PBmtg269:775	S1:	 it's for me it's
PBmtg269:776	S6:	 this 
PBmtg269:777	S3:	 i mean 
PBmtg269:778	S6:	 a very important step er a new step a new
PBmtg269:779	S1:	 yeah but the the most 
PBmtg269:780	S4:	 the most modern step or er or something or 
PBmtg269:781	S6:	 the most modern 
PBmtg269:782	S3:	 okay we'll come to that 
PBmtg269:783	S6:	 but not the latest
PBmtg269:784	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:785	S6:	 and the second one is that compact [thing1] are convenient because of less [thing1] 
PBmtg269:786	S3:	 i mean er you're addressing exactly the problems which we have i mean er there is very difficult is really to prove that this project has something to do with the convenience for consumers
PBmtg269:787	S6:	 yes but it's simply not true 
PBmtg269:788	S3:	 it it's simply does not have nothing to do with the consumer with the convenience for consumer okay because the only convenience for consumer which you can find is that someone will carry fifty-three per cent less [thing1] in the bag 
PBmtg269:789	S6:	 is that really xxxx very convenient 
PBmtg269:790	S3:	 coming back for supermarket
PBmtg269:791	S6:	 yes 
PBmtg269:792	S6:	 yes 
PBmtg269:793	S3:	 this is the only convenience which may happen
PBmtg269:794	S6:	 th- 
PBmtg269:795	S6:	 yes 
PBmtg269:796	S3:	 which is so trivial that don't even try to talk about it @@@@@@@ i mean this is a mi- a major problem in this project because we are not to talk about environment because [thing1] are not environmental friendly
PBmtg269:797	S6:	 yes
PBmtg269:798	S3:	 okay hh er we should erm m- moreover we can be we can be x that we propose something to consumer which is against their convenience and benefits we should find in this project er consumer benefits okay because then we will have a problem with european commission that we do something which is against maybe the consumers so we should i mean as a standard 
PBmtg269:799	S4:	 but 
PBmtg269:800	S3:	 industrial move yeah
PBmtg269:801	S4:	 yeah this is sort of one one thing that we er catched as er as something really good for consumer er at least in our country was that er we claimed somewhere there that er erm it is like five per cent less er of electricity you use
PBmtg269:802	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg269:803	S4:	 but mister [last name12] told me that it is not true it can't er logically be true because you just er use the same er washing program
PBmtg269:804	S7:	 washing 
PBmtg269:805	S4:	 your er you use in your washing machine hh the same machine 
PBmtg269:806	S7:	 the same machine the same electricity 
PBmtg269:807	S4:	 you just put a less of the of the powder which er 
PBmtg269:808	S7:	 yes 
PBmtg269:809	S7:	 [thing1] 
PBmtg269:810	S4:	 cannot influence that you save the electricity it would be great if we can s- claim it because electricity is becoming more er expensive 
PBmtg269:811	S3:	 we can
PBmtg269:812	S3:	 okay it depends on what 
PBmtg269:813	S4:	 but it's not true it is in your official er presentation
PBmtg269:814	S3:	 okay so 
PBmtg269:815	S3:	 no but erm erm the beauty is like this that basically er this compaction er can produce er major energy savings but in the process of production
PBmtg269:816	S4:	 yes and not in and 
PBmtg269:817	S3:	 and transportation
PBmtg269:818	S4:	 not in the household 
PBmtg269:819	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:820	S7:	 not for consumers
PBmtg269:821	S3:	 at the er consumers' end it might produce savings but only under the condition that consumers wish er avoid underfilling will wash in the lower temperature and will correct dose
PBmtg269:822	S4:	 and then in the end of the day they will not wash i don't know three times per week but only two ti- two times per week and and at the end of the year it is minus five per cent is it like that
PBmtg269:823	S3:	 something like that yes
PBmtg269:824	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg269:825	S3:	 that's why this is so important we will come to the message truck i will sho- show you now the message truck which is stakeholders no this is not this one hh er yeah okay it's not finished so in this sense where it's something 
PBmtg269:826	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:827	S3:	 what we would like to say for example our [thing1] has the same er our [thing1] has er the same efficacy so w- wash get the same quality perfor- performance of the product using thirty-three per cent less of powder okay let's assume that this is our key message then we go up and we say that compact [thing1] bring in convenience and performance yeah we as a producer can talk about performance we can talk about the quality of our product because we can say as a producer that er [thing5] and whatever er has the same quality the compacted form versus the one which was previous- previously on the market because the er nation- national association [org4] [org4] cannot say that because producers can change the formulation behind that move which is unpredictable er this i- this is responsibility of every single industry member player to secure the quality or or and performance of the product wide compaction or not to do this if we are going to secure and confirm our our erm performance of our product we can set in the center that no matter of the compaction our [thing1] wash the same got the same performance yes then we start to talk to consumers we as a producers about convenience less space at home about less weight to carry few choices in stores wash the same amount of laundry energy er save money by saving energy in water but it will happened only if and we er go now here and the on the erm left-hand side if correct washing er if you acc- er if you wash correctly if you accept er correct washing habits which are dose correctly wash at lowest recommended temperature fill up your machine consumer will no go- will got will get will have no chance to get any benefit behind this project if not accepting a completely new washing habits those three ones
PBmtg269:828	S6:	 why we don't stress this smaller amount of er washing powder you get the same performance
PBmtg269:829	S3:	 we can stress it it's our choice this might be in the middle we this could be our point of entry 
PBmtg269:830	S6:	 this can be this can be a good message for the consumer 
PBmtg269:831	S3:	 yes this can be our point of entry this cannot be point of entry of communication to the industry because industry as a whole cannot confirm that the performance of all washing powders will became on the market the same but we as at [org1] can say to our consumers we compact it but our [thing1] are erm er as good as it what used to be before got the same completely the same performance are more compacted are co- more convenient give you a chance to save the money but when you additionally accept the changed washing habits 
PBmtg269:832	S6:	 save the money
PBmtg269:833	S3:	 which are on your left-hand side and then you go to the right-hand side and by the way this is good for the environment for the society because in the whole production and transportation process you can save even twenty per cent of energy okay for example because this is something those numbers you will find in the scientific dossier for example they claim something like that yeah less packaging waste this will be something like ten per cent waste less [thing1] this is obvious less pooling biodegradable organic materials okay and at the end of the day we can say that we have our stakeholders that there many others who support us and are going to say that this is right thing to do so this is a message truck whenever a question will come this is one of the answers you should end up because this is key messages which we would like to convey to the to the public yeah hh er this message truck in the i- in the industry situation looks little different i- something different in the middle this thirty-three compaction i have entered by my- i mean i added by myself because [first name6] didn't [org2] didn't talk about this thirty-three per cent compacted product they told just only about the sustainability which is brings benefit to consumer society as a whole okay
PBmtg269:834	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:835	S3:	 what does it mean thirty-three per cent compaction 
PBmtg269:836	S1:	 so i was wrong there is xxx in sponsoring 
PBmtg269:837	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:838	S3:	 but still erm erm very much the same i mean the the the message truck is except this middle part which is different we can be more specific we can con- reassure our performance of our products here is just only blah blah blah for the benefits but which benefits we are the same at the same truck what is they now x laundry less space at whole less to carry okay but erm erm some savings but it will happen only if on the left-hand side you can adapt this new washing habits which are at not avoid underfilling er dose correctly lowest temperature on the right-hand side by the way this is very good for the environment and we have many supporters which are mini yeah something like that er and this is stakeholders' message truck to the consumers so what the stakeholders can say and here is the difference because stakeholders will push really or we expect the stakeholder to s- push the message of an on er of this environmental messages so they will say that this is right thing to do because this is benefit for the country benefit for society benefit for consumer because this is environmental benefit on the left-hand side energy saving less packaging hh so there are most focus of this environment okay but this all will happened or will happen in a stronger if consumer will accept new habits of washings this is on the right-hand side yeah so they are again talking about the dosage dosing about the temperature about other filling and things because at the end of the day er really a lot of things has to be done on the household level on the consumer level this can give really us er a benefit but erm erm the consumer has to changed to get a maximum out of the project also on the every household level because industry can really save energy er save water save whatever but if consumers won't do this what happened really okay and that's it so this is er i mean the beauty of the message truck i don't know er er okay this is not finished yet @@ but at least 
PBmtg269:839	S4:	 er like this is 
PBmtg269:840	S3:	 give you understanding of 
PBmtg269:841	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:842	S3:	 how it looks depending on who is the originator who is the the end consumer of the message truck here is also the message truck of the er the g- to consumers l s p what is l s p i don't remember i mean this [first name6] is very sophisticated er anyway 
PBmtg269:843	S1:	 @@@@ @
PBmtg269:844	S3:	 good so this is [org2] work basically yeah this is what i've showing you so i stealed everything from [org2] what i can and i share it with you @@@@@
PBmtg269:845	S1:	 @@@@@
PBmtg269:846	S3:	 but this is okay so with message truck coming back so this is really key message portfolio you will see when you will go individual because we cannot do it one by one by you through q and as you will see that we are trying to come back to this messages erm having in mind different questions which might happen not probably not everything of them but basically somewhere we are trying to end up or with the consumer benefit or with the environmental benefit or with the supporters or with the additional erm washing habits which consumers have to adopt somewhere end up answering any questions which might happen to xx i mean nasty question we trying to end up with the positive key message which we which we have okay so delivering on our importance suggested se- sequence so up then left right and bottom so this is the sequence hh with relevance to who is the message originator and who who is the message addressee man of communication whatever okay hh er this message actua- er took us through by basically to summarize who is going to talk a- about this project with the general public i would say that one hand there is an association okay association industry is talking about the project is launching the project it's good to have someone next to us like a stakeholders who will say this is right thing to do okay er this might be role model starting any stakeholders talking from role model who maybe we don't like that much but ending up with any environmental ministry which happen ministry of health consumer organization whoever who will be appropriate person to to support us we can talk just only if asked by media i cannot expe- i cannot imagine that media will not ask companies one by one that's why it's so important to have a common message truck by all companies shared common q and as at least as a base for further deliberation that's why we exchange each within the companies all documents which exist so whatever i have delivered i mean i have developed i share with [first name6] wha- whatever [first name6] did is shared with me and [first name8] whatever it was [first name8] thinking she shared with us just to make sure that at least within this key players of the market and the majority markets are [org1] and [org2] we are able to to say in the one voice okay i think that to- today or this week [first name6] is doing with his organization the same what we are doing here so he is briefing [org2] guys on all those er all those er project elements which we are trying to cover now with the same open questions no no- not resolved which erm erm erm we have because okay er anything else here not yet anything else i don't know 
PBmtg269:847	S7:	 but the communication of this all this messages so if we don't agree about the common usage of i don't know whatever p o s is with the working group so we do it alone is it allowed then
PBmtg269:848	S3:	 i don't think so
PBmtg269:849	S7:	 if if we cannot agree if somebody is against 
PBmtg269:850	S3:	 i mean er one thing is whether it is i mean i think that erm how to say no company would i mean the sense of investing if any activities is probably to share the costs because then you get a scale
PBmtg269:851	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:852	S3:	 yeah so erm the i mean beauty is that we can share the cost we have the bigger scale we can say that we all as a industry so i cannot imagine that one company will do on behalf of [org4] something which the others won't decide to do at least or okay you wanna spend money on this just spend but we have to know what you produce so all p o s is probably no matter if er everybody's decided to spend money on them but all p o ss at least should be agreed on the national associations' level
PBmtg269:853	SX-1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:854	S3:	 to have just consistency of the communication
PBmtg269:855	S1:	 mhm yeah 
PBmtg269:856	S3:	 this is what i think i mean the beauty er the i mean
PBmtg269:857	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:858	S3:	 the ideal situation that everybody's will agree on certain things and that we will share the cost because then 
PBmtg269:859	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:860	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:861	S3:	 but if not i don't know how it happened 
PBmtg269:862	S7:	 okay 
PBmtg269:863	S3:	 at at least in [place1] i know that we have advertising and probably will have print for sure not billboards
PBmtg269:864	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:865	S3:	 i think so i mean there is no support for billboards at wi- at least within [org1] and [org2] didn't come with the billboards campaign proposal until now so i i don't think that will come still
PBmtg269:866	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:867	S3:	 yeah leaflets were not discussed yet no one will 
PBmtg269:868	S4:	 no one will 
PBmtg269:869	S3:	 nobody came with the idea i'm going to come with the idea on tuesday yeah tomorrow because we 
PBmtg269:870	S4:	 what about web pages 
PBmtg269:871	S3:	 what
PBmtg269:872	S4:	 what about web internet is there going to be at least some information on [org4] erm 
PBmtg269:873	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:874	S3:	 i don't know the web was not covered hh could be a good question i don't know no one was thinking about
PBmtg269:875	S4:	 because er journalists may also refer to you know which i think 
PBmtg269:876	S3:	 do [org4] has a page do [org4] has a page yeah
PBmtg269:877	S4:	 yep 
PBmtg269:878	S1:	 yes yeah 
PBmtg269:879	SX-f:	 yes 
PBmtg269:880	S1:	 of course i think that they will have the 
PBmtg269:881	S3:	 but really every country
PBmtg269:882	S1:	 haeh
PBmtg269:883	S3:	 every country every country
PBmtg269:884	S1:	 i don't maybe the main country i i
PBmtg269:885	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:886	S1:	 had a look on it and they had different coun- -try sides i have to check this 
PBmtg269:887	S4:	 erm it's a question of er if they have some of their press releases on the
PBmtg269:888	S1:	 yeah of course normal they have the press 
PBmtg269:889	S4:	 [org4] dot org or something like that then it has to be in line with what we @@ what we communicate
PBmtg269:890	S3:	 i mean but er any 
PBmtg269:891	S4:	 it has to be er 
PBmtg269:892	S3:	 any press releases which are going to be er 
PBmtg269:893	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg269:894	S3:	 erm issued er erm during the the run of this project 
PBmtg269:895	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:896	S3:	 will be originated by [org5] okay so at least this blueprint this master 
PBmtg269:897	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:898	S3:	 press release will come from 
PBmtg269:899	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:900	S3:	 er [org5] who will share it with the organizations for adaptation so at least the core 
PBmtg269:901	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:902	S3:	 should be more or less the same 
PBmtg269:903	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:904	S3:	 then of course depending on stakeholders depending on role model depending on anything else
PBmtg269:905	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:906	S3:	 this will start to vary but key messages should be er somehow in synergy only er or at least only because there will be one master press release done by [org5] regionally and share it with the organization with the network 
PBmtg269:907	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:908	S3:	 hh er then
PBmtg269:909	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:910	S3:	 yeah hh erm okay i think that er i'm going to s- erm tomorrow i'm going to have a meeting with [first name7] and one of the things which we'll try to discuss will be er c p s meaning what is to be delivered on the regional basis by when all those things which are necessary for our national network 
PBmtg269:911	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:912	S3:	 for the country network to work with has to be delivered [thing4] [thing4] has to be delivered like i should i have here 
PBmtg269:913	S4:	 some timelines you know 
PBmtg269:914	S3:	 timelines yeah so okay we do not have yet timelines this is only because the c p s which [first name7] included into the presentation ended at the end of april i don't want agency to end working end of april once we launch the product the the initiative on april eighteenth will be impossible okay
PBmtg269:915	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:916	SX-f:	 pf 
PBmtg269:917	S3:	 so someone is trying to make us stupid but i don't think so that we will agree at least on this yeah so erm this one erm erm this is one of the reasons why this presentation do not incorporate any c p s because i mean to smooth the process i said [first name7] okay let's get rid of the c p s charts 
PBmtg269:918	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:919	S3:	 we will discuss it on tuesday so on tuesday or maybe during the week i should have some information about the c p s on the regional level 
PBmtg269:920	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:921	S3:	 i don't think and i will try to discourage [first name7] try to work upon c p ss on the country level because i don't think it's necessary i mean i think that every country will do more or less i don't know they would like probably to hh work c p ss for the countries like a master master c p s maybe something i did for your orientation what agency was asked for under i mean from the headquarter hh but i don't think we had really to keep this on the country levels if you think differently yeah if the national association had different er thinking i i think that a- at least c p s can be changed maybe not key messages but at least c p s yeah hh okay er potential issues there are many potential issues which you will find in the q and as 
PBmtg269:922	S3:	 so q and as one of the er the way of of yeah this was my version if you have something er slash one it was my version so this is to recognize [first name6] answers my o- my answers so question number seven this is a proposal of my answers to question number seven [first name6] has something different okay hhh what is the benefit of the project okay and this is er an attempt to put into the answers all this key messages or all message trucks element which we have on that review like the use of environmental impact of [thing1] consumer convenience washing correctly meaning new habits thanks to which we can save energy water and [thing1] also in the households something like that okay so but you will have something like er forty questions er in the q and as documents 
PBmtg269:923	SX-f:	 @
PBmtg269:924	S3:	 so this is er new li- nice library i can assure you 
PBmtg269:925	S5:	 [S3] sorry this are questions er for the company or to the industries 
PBmtg269:926	S3:	 not for the xxx for the industry
PBmtg269:927	S5:	 for the industry 
PBmtg269:928	S3:	 this is for the xx 
PBmtg269:929	S1:	 no the the company never appears i think 
PBmtg269:930	S3:	 no never no never 
PBmtg269:931	S1:	 never we never talk as [org1] yeah
PBmtg269:932	S3:	 or only if we are asked for it
PBmtg269:933	S1:	 if we are asked for it 
PBmtg269:934	S3:	 if you are asked for by media that okay do you know about the and what you did 
PBmtg269:935	S5:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:936	S1:	 mhm okay 
PBmtg269:937	S3:	 so we trying to erm i mean convey all the messages which industry conveying plus some additional which industry cannot do like about the performance that our products this compacted are the same good performance and quality as 
PBmtg269:938	S1:	 mhm
PBmtg269:939	S3:	 it was before
PBmtg269:940	S5:	 but as we decided in [place3] that the spokesperson for the industry will be is [first name6] 
PBmtg269:941	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:942	S5:	 means he is
PBmtg269:943	S3:	 he will talk always as a i- as a national association 
PBmtg269:944	S5:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:945	S5:	 yeah yeah
PBmtg269:946	S3:	 never like a [org2] 
PBmtg269:947	S5:	 yeah yeah
PBmtg269:948	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:949	S5:	 mhm we agreed on this yes some kind of and those questions are meant for 
PBmtg269:950	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:951	S5:	 questions 
PBmtg269:952	S1:	 yeah but er mister [last name13] should also know this because some maybe he he is asked personally what do you think about the [org4] project then he should also 
PBmtg269:953	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg269:954	S5:	 then 
PBmtg269:955	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:956	S1:	 have the same er wording then yeah 
PBmtg269:957	S5:	 cou- yeah 
PBmtg269:958	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:959	S3:	 exactly so i mean the the approa- [first name6] approach is that q and as this is like a background that q and as should not even be translated into local languages i mean do whatever you want this is approach of [org2] approach okay that q and as i took q and as as we usually treat q and as ready-to-go answers okay you never learn by heart this answers because it's impossible but at least to give you erm give you the the the the feeling how to escape from the very tough questions to the to g- go be back to the message truck okay
PBmtg269:960	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:961	S3:	 they think that this is also such an experience for someone who was provided with q and as this is kind of experience this is kind of media training for the person but really what the only the the only things which person can really grab understand and stick to is message truck because it's one page there no one will remember how to answer thirty or forty questions tough questions which were in the q and as so what is important is important to have message truck all the q and as were tried to be answered having message ground truck agreed okay so 
PBmtg269:962	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:963	S3:	 so this give you a feeling how to escape from uncomfortable points to the more comfortable for you points 
PBmtg269:964	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:965	S3:	 something like that erm so at least this is approach of [first name6] i think that practical one this is practical yeah but at least s- some attempts how to answer the t- tough questions and h- how to escape from the toughest uncomfortable xxx to the our key messages of the message truck but you have i don't remember thirty-four questions there hhh okay [org5] responsibilities this is basically so regional concept and plate program development on the regional level yeah this is what agency has finally delivered this is what on this blue background with the blue background this is what agency hh er proposed us there were more slides i erm i cut few slides so the proposal of [org5] was little bit longer but the essence is there okay so they did it hh providing local n- network on the countries level as [S1] has mentions this is important in in case of such a comprehensive project with many different stakeholders with man- i mean many different companies xxxx having one agency who will trying to synergize the communication across the whole region will be really an asset so this is something which we expect from [org5] to have a network local country-tailored adaptations of the program this is what is going and should happened on every country level er in cooperation with national associations so at the at the level of national association w- which might means that it would be you or it would be you and one colleague from [org2] hh [org5] should propose a plan how to adapt the regional concept and one and elements of executional el- which executional elements they will do on the country levels budget management as i was said agency got the money agency got the majority of money end of january and should not ask ask for any money correlated to the budget the question it's whether we can really work up on the split which was suggested by the agency meaning can we really have a chance to get something from the agency fee and put it into executionals if not we have to live with money which was in the letter of intent and that's it hopefully not hh but the budget managing basically is on the agency side however we knows the numbers so it might be 
PBmtg269:966	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg269:967	S1:	 sorry [S3] but they have a controlling 
PBmtg269:968	S3:	 er 
PBmtg269:969	S1:	 you get a monthly report of them and yes and and @@@
PBmtg269:970	S3:	 yeah of course 
PBmtg269:971	S3:	 yes of course they they they promised to yah sure 
PBmtg269:972	S1:	 @
PBmtg269:973	S3:	 but the so okay but the question is should we talk about because if we start of the money then i don't know how to make it because 
PBmtg269:974	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:975	S3:	 whenever they are going to deliver all points which are in the menu i don't mind how what they spend okay but i think that at the end of the day they will come 
PBmtg269:976	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:977	S1:	 i understand yeah 
PBmtg269:978	S3:	 with the with the money to me that they do not have money for the execution yeah
PBmtg269:979	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg269:980	S3:	 so at this at this point we sh- probably we will have to start talking money with them but if not i i i would personally propose to 
PBmtg269:981	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:982	S1:	 it's okay yeah 
PBmtg269:983	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:984	S3:	 push them to do anything what is possible 
PBmtg269:985	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:986	S3:	 don't asking about the money
PBmtg269:987	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:988	S3:	 because agency got the money on the regional level it will be 
PBmtg269:989	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:990	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:991	S3:	 i mean i will try at least i i make a nice try or if not i will have to start talking about the money but nice try is 
PBmtg269:992	S1:	 no it's 
PBmtg269:993	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:994	S1:	 there is 
PBmtg269:995	S3:	 is probably essential at the beginning hh okay program coordination this is what er also agency promised that they will coordinate across the whole region that will erm erm i mean try to care about the synergy across the region and er among the countries and for sure agency is responsible for the execution issue management as i said at the very beginning in the [org5] proposal was that er erm [org5] will be paid extra for the any issue management what happened on the our level so for the every one hour of work additional one hundred one er euro @@@@@ hh so okay this was negotiated so issue management and is within the fee x and achievements assessment meaning every every month they are suppos- i mean a- again i think that you should try to er set it on every country level how often you would like to see an agency how often they will should come with the reports every two weeks every three weeks every one one every month i don't know it will depends it you you should do it on your own according to what you think er will be right for your agency and for the country and for the project which you are going to run in your country i mean 
PBmtg269:996	S5:	 and [S3] and monitoring it was mentioned i think er i believe er they will have to be provided 
PBmtg269:997	S4:	 they will also 
PBmtg269:998	S3:	 yes 
PBmtg269:999	S5:	 uhu 
PBmtg269:1000	S3:	 for sure i think as well 
PBmtg269:1001	S4:	 this issues management er does it what actually is erm wha- what is covered by for example is er issue of phosphates now that is really becoming er quite er important in the project is it also covered in in in this
PBmtg269:1002	S3:	 yes 
PBmtg269:1003	S4:	 yeah
PBmtg269:1004	S3:	 yes whatever is related whatever is hot getting hot 
PBmtg269:1005	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1006	S3:	 with the correlation to the project whatever you are asked because this project is running is part of the game
PBmtg269:1007	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1008	S3:	 so for for sure for example we will we we will not probably have this phosphate questions in our q and as and we would not expect them but you for sure and this is role of the agency to give a nice recommendation how to deal with this problem 
PBmtg269:1009	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1010	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg269:1011	S4:	 cos it's also they are paid erm because i chose them as agency for [org1] 
PBmtg269:1012	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1013	S4:	 and they are paid with a monthly fee for [org1] and now they will have a fee for [org4] but it is the same work
PBmtg269:1014	S1:	 this is the same 
PBmtg269:1015	S3:	 no
PBmtg269:1016	S1:	 no it's not it's not the same work 
PBmtg269:1017	S4:	 in some 
PBmtg269:1018	S4:	 in some in some cases 
PBmtg269:1019	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1020	S4:	 it's the same peo- the same person
PBmtg269:1021	S3:	 oh yeah it might happened that this is the same person
PBmtg269:1022	S4:	 and er so this is the biggest part of our work in the first er 
PBmtg269:1023	S1:	 but it's another project 
PBmtg269:1024	S4:	 first few months of er of the year 
PBmtg269:1025	S1:	 a- er attention er you can't use your budget f- your corporate communications budget for [org4] 
PBmtg269:1026	S4:	 yeah i know 
PBmtg269:1027	S1:	 you can't use it yeah 
PBmtg269:1028	S4:	 i i just i'm afraid that er erm agency will use this as getting er some er er 
PBmtg269:1029	S1:	 no they can't 
PBmtg269:1030	S4:	 big amount of money from one side from the other side and then 
PBmtg269:1031	S1:	 what they do with the money it's it's not our problem yeah they have to deliver for you for the corporate communication for [org1] 
PBmtg269:1032	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1033	S1:	 and they have to deliver for [org4] how they mix it up and make apart it's not our problem 
PBmtg269:1034	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1035	S3:	 as long as they are again only according to the plan and according to expectation on the whole projects 
PBmtg269:1036	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1037	S1:	 but 
PBmtg269:1038	S1:	 but if they 
PBmtg269:1039	S1:	 er if they try they ask then you can say and sorry this is different budgets yeah 
PBmtg269:1040	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1041	S3:	 you got your money al- already from [place13] yeah
PBmtg269:1042	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1043	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1044	S3:	 okay so hh [first name7] [last name7] and i give you this name because it might be important because during talking with er with your partners in your countries they might call this name he's the leader of the project from the [org5] unfortunately located in [place1] @@@ so this is @ really 
PBmtg269:1045	S1:	 @@@@@
PBmtg269:1046	S3:	 really shitty job @ so he is here and he is er coordina- i mean development of the concept of the executional manual development of the er of some elements of those so-called blueprints like press releases like survey because if it has to be across the countries it has to be coordinated or decided once at the the very beginning maybe maybe a partnership but this is something which er he said maybe yes maybe no but for sure coordination er for su- for sure program budgetings all questions on program bu- budgets w- will come back somehow to him hh er and cooperation with association and marketing task force are xx xxx or whatever yeah local [org5] program applications execution recognizing stakeholders corporation er budget management er corporation with national associations and results assessments of course clippings should be clippings all this yeah but this is results assessment this is kind of results assessment yeah this 
PBmtg269:1047	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1048	S3:	 and this understanding next steps 
PBmtg269:1049	S1:	 xxx 
PBmtg269:1050	S3:	 we are coming to the end now i guess 
PBmtg269:1051	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1052	S3:	 thanks for that @ okay so be the members of the working groups in the associations for sure 
PBmtg269:1053	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1054	S3:	 for whoever was not 
PBmtg269:1055	SX-f:	 @
PBmtg269:1056	S3:	 till now has to be then i think that this week and ne- next week should be this kick-off meetings for the agency er i think that this objective which was set for the [place3] meaning that agency will come and will try to brief all national associations' member about the project is right because i know about the project now you know about the project maybe someone else from [org2] will know about the project but in the association there are many others members which have no clue about er what p r is er about at all not kn- kn- thinking about they have no idea what's really p r program for for this project means so i think that this first meeting should be like kick-off meeting to brief all members of national association with the general concept giving feedbe- feedbacking agency on what we think maybe talking about stakeholders is appropriate for sure in some countries er where [org2] is maybe not that active with the regulations and er asking them to come back with the m- proposals of country-tailored er plan p r program something like january erm erm for i- i- another two or three weeks we should give them probably yeah and that's it this is what should happen er in timings er just for the next month yeah then of course the corporation will depends on who should be the direct reporting line for the agency because this is again so- how you how are decided in was no 
PBmtg269:1057	S5:	 all old members 
PBmtg269:1058	S1:	 ooph 
PBmtg269:1059	S5:	 directly xx x x 
PBmtg269:1060	S3:	 it won- it won't work i mean it won't work i mean i i think that it should be one the m- er i mean the most two persons who will really work with the [org5] because it's never works in the group with more than one two persons 
PBmtg269:1061	S5:	 but then they will be stronger the stronger ones will be [org2] and [org1] because all the others er some of the trade er er came to this meeting er some of them were not er er 
PBmtg269:1062	S1:	 invited 
PBmtg269:1063	S5:	 er were didn't know about the project yet and er 
PBmtg269:1064	S3:	 then what i what i would suggest i i mean of course national association should be should have the erm [org5] program presented at some period of time okay to get a comparance of all members of national association 
PBmtg269:1065	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1066	S3:	 but i think that this has to be something agreed already between [org5] [org1] and [org2] 
PBmtg269:1067	S5:	 mhm i believe it will work like the work like this but 
PBmtg269:1068	S3:	 i think that it should be like this and then 
PBmtg269:1069	S5:	 it was so funny situation because erm all the others were looking so sadly so that [first name6] to- @ er t- told to them so er er you all have the possibility we all have this possibility to talk directly to [org5] so 
PBmtg269:1070	S1:	 yeah but i think they 
PBmtg269:1071	S5:	 at the end i believe er [org2] and [org1] will be 
PBmtg269:1072	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:1073	S5:	 the most active part it was 
PBmtg269:1074	S3:	 maybe it was political a political move yeah 
PBmtg269:1075	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1076	S5:	 i believe it was 
PBmtg269:1077	S3:	 yeah it was but at the end of the day probably one or two persons and no more because it will never work 
PBmtg269:1078	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1079	S3:	 okay this two person has to decide what is right for the country and just er let the agency work because otherwise we will be in the middle of nowhere 
PBmtg269:1080	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1081	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1082	S3:	 i mean with all those people giving feedback 
PBmtg269:1083	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1084	S3:	 never-ending story the same was 
PBmtg269:1085	S1:	 yeah i know this from [place14] from the association normally they send it to all members but then they send all back their 
PBmtg269:1086	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1087	S1:	 statements and it's for me it's 
PBmtg269:1088	S3:	 it's 
PBmtg269:1089	S1:	 horrible yeah 
PBmtg269:1090	S3:	 it's horrible 
PBmtg269:1091	S1:	 but erm yeah 
PBmtg269:1092	S3:	 it's political but er er i would if possible i would i would try to avoid to giving the chance to all those people who don't have 
PBmtg269:1093	S1:	 ridicul- 
PBmtg269:1094	S1:	 you cannot 
PBmtg269:1095	S3:	 er who don't know what is p r really to give them a chance to feedback all press releases for example 
PBmtg269:1096	S1:	 and 
PBmtg269:1097	S1:	 i think more or less the p r -related persons who should do this no- not the r n d 
PBmtg269:1098	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1099	S3:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg269:1100	S1:	 they they can have with the arguments but i think to bring it to the consumers it's the task of the p r men 
PBmtg269:1101	S3:	 you're right for sure this is like er in [place1] it was the same i never worked with the association before we have this mister [last name14] with who was from r n d who was er active member of 
PBmtg269:1102	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1103	S3:	 er association [thing1] association in [place1] and once this project started i mean with the nice kick from the [thing1] side i was invited for the meeting so yeah i think that this we just has to because this is the the the the beauty of this project
PBmtg269:1104	S4:	 [S3] i'm not sure i'm understanding this erm d- d- did you think about er erm [org5] should present the the concept to all the members
PBmtg269:1105	S3:	 i mean at this meeting of task 
PBmtg269:1106	S4:	 like of r n d and marketing and others
PBmtg269:1107	S3:	 i mean who will be at this because for example er tomorrow we have in [place1] a meeting of the national association on this project there will be for example media plan covered maybe it's something about advertising xx i i mean er media plan okay media plan 
PBmtg269:1108	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1109	S3:	 whatever whatever media we decided to choose 
PBmtg269:1110	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1111	S3:	 and there will be p r there are two topic agreed that within the group 
PBmtg269:1112	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1113	S3:	 who are the people interested to the association with this project two topics will be discussed
PBmtg269:1114	S4:	 yeah mhm 
PBmtg269:1115	S3:	 that's it so who appears will discuss who will not appear will have no decisions 
PBmtg269:1116	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1117	S3:	 but everybody who are somehow was established as a working group worked for the [org4] for project there are representatives of we have [org1] [org2] [org10] [org11] because [org11] is someone important 
PBmtg269:1118	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1119	S3:	 [org12] does not appear because w- with two per cent of the market they are not interested er in in er they don't wanna 
PBmtg269:1120	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1121	S3:	 they xxx there is [thing6] this baby [thing1] but i don't remember who else and probably that's it yeah
PBmtg269:1122	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1123	S3:	 so those people are going to appear on the next meeting and those people will have a chance to hear something about the regional concept for p r program
PBmtg269:1124	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1125	S3:	 and they are to say yes this is something which we want to happened 
PBmtg269:1126	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1127	S4:	 but if we formed already the p r group then er we can discuss it with p r 
PBmtg269:1128	S3:	 no this is not p r this is a marketing task force this is a if [org4] four task force this is called [org4] four task force
PBmtg269:1129	S4:	 but if we if we have the 
PBmtg269:1130	S3:	 x 
PBmtg269:1131	S4:	 but if we had p r group let's say then er we can discuss it within this p r group and er i'm just afraid of a first meeting with er too many people who can't too much discuss @@ discuss it they had a pre-information
PBmtg269:1132	S3:	 you know that 
PBmtg269:1133	S4:	 they had a pr- er th- the whole group had a pre-information
PBmtg269:1134	S3:	 and how many is in the whole group how many 
PBmtg269:1135	S4:	 the er the whole group is er 
PBmtg269:1136	S3:	 huh 
PBmtg269:1137	S4:	 er like r n d group and marketing group and the p r group
PBmtg269:1138	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1139	S4:	 this is it three groups altogether this is the 
PBmtg269:1140	S1:	 ooph 
PBmtg269:1141	S3:	 i mean they should be probably briefed on the concept
PBmtg269:1142	S4:	 that's it 
PBmtg269:1143	S4:	 yeah but maybe later on maybe the first would be that the meeting i think it's maybe better to meet er only with p r people to make it clear and then only to pick s- some some small part to tell them this is going to this and then and not 
PBmtg269:1144	S3:	 i mean er they started this on your side i think i mean i will go with er presentation to the whole group done by [org5] on the regional concept and kick off let's come back in two weeks time with the proposal but then i would 
PBmtg269:1145	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1146	S3:	 probably i would prefer to get something f- i mean to agreed o- what they want to present in two weeks time 
PBmtg269:1147	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1148	S3:	 not to be surprised in front of th- of others so i probably won't let [org5] to present something which i will be not happy with just because if everybody starts and i start to question agency in front of others it won't be politically correct and it won't bring any benefits to the to the results of the of the meeting 
PBmtg269:1149	S4:	 i know that's 
PBmtg269:1150	S4:	 that's what i wanted to es- erm escape 
PBmtg269:1151	S3:	 yeah yeah so at least you should be in line with the agency to be able to support or defend somehow agency and your th- your thinking via the agency or er agency via your thinking because otherwise yah
PBmtg269:1152	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1153	S1:	 okay so on the one 
PBmtg269:1154	S3:	 mid-march mid-june this is what i said i think that the program sure lasts 
PBmtg269:1155	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1156	S3:	 i mean the execution of the program executional elements of the p r program should be mid-march mid-june assuming that the advertising started on april eighteenth yah this will be the s- er three months of time of agency engagement p r program running mentioned in creative brief if so i think that this will be something which i would like to have a look with [first name7] [last name7] i don't know whether you agree on this or not you would like to have something different later end-march 
PBmtg269:1157	S4:	 well i don't think it's the first eighty ninety per cent we can say it in september but maybe there are some like add-ons er during during that period of time but er it will be an only small percentage of what is issued in the media i think september rea- is realistic 
PBmtg269:1158	S3:	 september by september they won't do it by september 
PBmtg269:1159	S4:	 yeah like this assessment we are talking about assessment of the results 
PBmtg269:1160	S3:	 what
PBmtg269:1161	S3:	 ah results 
PBmtg269:1162	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1163	S3:	 ah yeah results september this is okay 
PBmtg269:1164	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1165	S3:	 but how l- l- l- let's this er program execution 
PBmtg269:1166	S4:	 oh yeah 
PBmtg269:1167	S3:	 is this mid- -march maybe june 
PBmtg269:1168	S5:	 end 
PBmtg269:1169	S3:	 end-march end-june but we have er to have in mind that in the creative brief it was said that this is three er m- months of er program execution
PBmtg269:1170	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1171	S3:	 so we should to the three months because they will not work longer @
PBmtg269:1172	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1173	S4:	 if i di- if i did a ceremony which we agreed at er should be er as soon as possible for signing of the of the licence agreement 
PBmtg269:1174	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1175	S4:	 then we go er for beginning of er or first half of the february 
PBmtg269:1176	S3:	 do you want to make it 
PBmtg269:1177	S4:	 very important 
PBmtg269:1178	S3:	 i- in public
PBmtg269:1179	SX-f:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1180	S3:	 publicly
PBmtg269:1181	S4:	 i want to make it public because of erm er getting er the small companies and private labor producers and so on and retail pa- er partners on our side so this should be their communication why they should come and sign it as soon as possible but it can also change because of this phosphate issue it 
PBmtg269:1182	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1183	S4:	 it depends 
PBmtg269:1184	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1185	S4:	 because i'm not sure if we get er enough er along three er third parties er people on our side till till this er february
PBmtg269:1186	S3:	 uhu hh i mean er er we will have also decide the issue xxx but i don't think that we will go to media participations that will be just only ceremony for the participants so it it won't be correlated with the announcement of the project
PBmtg269:1187	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1188	S3:	 because i would like to make this announcement having on my side stakeholders 
PBmtg269:1189	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1190	S3:	 who would already say yes let's do this let's whatever it's er let's do whatever it takes er to convince consumers to educate consumers because this is right thing to happened to our environment to society to our saving that energy xxx 
PBmtg269:1191	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1192	S3:	 yeah so i would probabl- we will have the signing ceremony but we will not go to make it make it public event with the participation i think xxx event yes but not with the participation i think okay
PBmtg269:1193	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1194	S3:	 okay so those are attachments with i promised at the end so you have sustainability licensing agreement because as you know the erm the company's er getting er 
PBmtg269:1195	S3:	 that version okay whenever it's er ended up the working of all in and when i have a final one i will send it to you of course hh xx memorandum this is this legal briefing of the legal erm er legal looking at the project with all potential questions and issues which might happen with some suggestions how to resolve this questions and issues hh executional guidelines for n- er for national association and local task force final okay so this is a document that you will find what you should do at the level of national association in terms of marketing and in terms of p r okay so this is an official document which was issued for your understanding hh er presentation for national associations of the sustainability project template presentation of national associations of the presentations probably which used [first name9] to brief you on the pro- on the project er p r campaign will be final this is what i have sent you also via email but you have on c d as well q and as this one which we have discussed with erm different version of answers for the same s- questions take whatever you like hh er p r scientific dossier final and summary one page of summary of the scientific dossier so all library which was created upon this project you will get hh have a nice dream
PBmtg269:1196	S1:	 @ thank you 
PBmtg269:1197	S4:	 and the press release will 
PBmtg269:1198	S3:	 will come over time no not yet come on xx 
PBmtg269:1199	S4:	 i am because i am this er february x you know i'm not in march i'm in february 
PBmtg269:1200	S3:	 okay so when you would like depends xx weeks 
PBmtg269:1201	S5:	 media briefing we we have planned it for 
PBmtg269:1202	S4:	 first week of january 
PBmtg269:1203	S5:	 start of march 
PBmtg269:1204	S3:	 okay start of march end of february
PBmtg269:1205	S5:	 or mid-march 
PBmtg269:1206	S4:	 i i r- the first plan for the ceremony is ninth ninth feb- er ninth of february february the ninth 
PBmtg269:1207	S3:	 ninth
PBmtg269:1208	S4:	 yes 
PBmtg269:1209	S1:	 yeah who decided this because i can't 
PBmtg269:1210	S4:	 the association 
PBmtg269:1211	S1:	 yeah but i mean i think they should also coordinate 
PBmtg269:1212	S5:	 who should do this 
PBmtg269:1213	S1:	 with the plan 
PBmtg269:1214	S4:	 but this is the this is the first er erm first draft o- or first proposal of this er date but of course er er everything depends on when we get the the information if we don't get the information hh but still we are depending also on er the min- the time of the m- the minister of environment because er 
PBmtg269:1215	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1216	S4:	 he is most probably on our side and he can also speak on the ceremony he can be the the er the person who er gives us support er in that case his er er time is very limited and we cannot 
PBmtg269:1217	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1218	S4:	 change it every every three days so we have to pr- prepare at least some er some ideas of the of the date we cannot change it every time
PBmtg269:1219	S1:	 yeah that's not the question but the question is er to start a- -ccordingly to the plan yeah to the the plan of the agency be- otherwise it's a problem if you don't have any tools then you can't work 
PBmtg269:1220	S4:	 all we all m- we already know what we we won't be we already started with a lot we did a lot of working without the agency because if we waited on the a- the agency then we would have the progra- the the whole project sometime in the summer or something because we er it is it was not our fault that all the agency er erm thing was so so late so we already did a lot of work we already er picked up some n g os which are r- relevant and so on and we also had to do it because of the phosphates issue because 
PBmtg269:1221	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1222	S4:	 there the erm really really erm a lot changing the position of er the industry because on one side we want to say that er we do something good on the other side or 
PBmtg269:1223	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1224	S4:	 or big producers like [org2] and and [org10] are coming back to to phosphates so they will tell us if we are crazy @@
PBmtg269:1225	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1226	S4:	 at the end of the day that we are not er credible that is 
PBmtg269:1227	S3:	 mhm okay 
PBmtg269:1228	S4:	 so it's it's like er we want to do a- as as erm the best work we can do but at the on the other side er it can fall into the water 
PBmtg269:1229	S3:	 yeah but on th- on the other side if there is a creative brief that agency will gets to work for three months period if you start in february you have agency by may ninth
PBmtg269:1230	S4:	 ouch hh 
PBmtg269:1231	S3:	 and thank you very much because the agency will say come on 
PBmtg269:1232	S4:	 i don't think erm it can happen of course but erm i don't think they will at least in [place2] they will do it like that i w- i will go into xx 
PBmtg269:1233	S3:	 because they are fresh yes you are right they are quite fresh and they 
PBmtg269:1234	S4:	 yeah and 
PBmtg269:1235	S4:	 they just started and they all they have all the reasons to show themselves 
PBmtg269:1236	S3:	 yes you're right yes 
PBmtg269:1237	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1238	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1239	S3:	 okay okay but basically basically i will try to make er er agree that agency will start working like mid-march with some exceptions which might happened yeah
PBmtg269:1240	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1241	S3:	 till mid- -june yeah
PBmtg269:1242	S4:	 mhm

PBmtg269:1283	S4:	 damage of the health
PBmtg269:1284	S3:	 but there is no n g os who say because at least what what i've heard in [place1] is that they are depends on an 
PBmtg269:1285	S4:	 equal
PBmtg269:1286	S3:	 n g o a different erm perspective erm a rough evaluation of the of the impact of [thing1] phosphates er upon the environment is like two up to twenty per cent so only five up to twenty per cent something between five of twent- it depends on the on the
PBmtg269:1287	S4:	 yeah we all know that 
PBmtg269:1288	S3:	 on the x organizations
PBmtg269:1289	S4:	 but there are 
PBmtg269:1290	S3:	 only this amount er getting is getting to the environment the 
PBmtg269:1291	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1292	S3:	 because of the [thing1] the rest because of the the fertilizers 
PBmtg269:1293	S4:	 yeah we we know that
PBmtg269:1294	S4:	 yeah but the problem is that er during er last 
PBmtg269:1295	S3:	 so 
PBmtg269:1296	S4:	 i don't know number of years we were all of er we were forbidden to to communicate about phosphates 
PBmtg269:1297	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg269:1298	S4:	 just on a react-to basis and since we did not communicate it er before nobody er changed this view that of er there is the commonly shared view that er [thing1] are the most problematic for the for the er er on because of the phosphates hh and er it is er it is my belief that it is due to our lack of communication in the last years and now if we wanted to do something it will be too hard to change it now because it is widely shared that really [thing1] are 
PBmtg269:1299	S3:	 that [thing1] are responsible responsible number one yeah
PBmtg269:1300	S4:	 responsible for 
PBmtg269:1301	S4:	 yeah number one responsible 
PBmtg269:1302	S3:	 but it's not true 
PBmtg269:1303	S4:	 it is not true but everybody thinks that so how will you will we hh change the opinion of people media er n g os and everybody 
PBmtg269:1304	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1305	S1:	 yeah but that was the 
PBmtg269:1306	S1:	 it was the reason why have the phosphate-free 
PBmtg269:1307	S4:	 through several months
PBmtg269:1308	S1:	 they have not change 
PBmtg269:1309	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg269:1310	S4:	 yeah [org1] is out of it but er hh er because we can always say erm yeah we are 
PBmtg269:1311	S3:	 we do not have phosphates 
PBmtg269:1312	S4:	 we don't have phosphates but er the credibility of industry
PBmtg269:1313	S3:	 for years now 
PBmtg269:1314	S4:	 which is behind this project is in question because er [org2] and [org1] either are g- going back to phosphates because it is cheaper for them it is 
PBmtg269:1315	S3:	 hh 
PBmtg269:1316	S4:	 easier because er everybody er around the countries are producing phosphates and [place2] was er the only island without phosphates
PBmtg269:1317	S3:	 but er but it's really not the er industry i mean er this is the ministry step the ministry move which has to happened will be the ban signed or will not be signed yeah what happened if the ban is signed [org2] and [org10] will cope with wi- wi- will aligned with this ban yeah
PBmtg269:1318	S4:	 yeah and but it has to b- er it has to be also for a small producer producers which have problems with the with this phosphates er change because they don't have the money to change the chronology or that's the problem the smaller ones the local ones 
PBmtg269:1319	S3:	 if your minister want 
PBmtg269:1320	S3:	 do you think that minister will she signed this ban or not
PBmtg269:1321	S4:	 it is er unfortunately it is not only up to minister it is only up er it is also up to other ministries which can er give the veto to that

PBmtg269:1331	S3:	 and they wanted to have that 
PBmtg269:1332	S4:	 and now there is a big big open open question of phosphates hh and then we come with the with the new issue that can really be quite easily lost with all the phosphates issues that have that aligned because now the public is er bec- erm learning about ph- that phosphates are possible and since er it was er several years a program about phosphates then it is erm yeah a big issue for them you know
