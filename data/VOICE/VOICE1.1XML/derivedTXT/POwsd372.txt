POwsd372:119	SX-1:	 mhm 
POwsd372:120	S12:	 that well it was mentioned in the policy papers as well is that we need to be given the tools in order to be able to do that and we need concrete a con- something that's concrete that says that yes we are going to look look more into this now we are going to be m- erm not just give funding and passé but to say a certain amount of money needs to be given to youth organizations to y- who do this kind of work with youth

POwsd372:133	SX-f:	 yes and 
POwsd372:134	S1:	 er er okay i think we can we can include this as a as a separate point in terms of what youth organizations do or i- and we can even look further er what else youth organizations could do in order to improve the situation but also what would be the needs next to that yeah so for example you were mentioning the fact 
POwsd372:135	S12:	 mhm 
POwsd372:136	S1:	 that er there is a certain personal and professional development when volunteering in a in a youth organization er and recognizing that role is is very important but this recognition should be also backed by backed up by you know financial support

POwsd372:142	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd372:143	S12:	 that youth needs to be included as part of the decision-making process 
POwsd372:144	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd372:145	S2:	 that's actually something that i can be proud of when when when talking about because finland has er er recently i think it was a year ago we adopted a youth law and in this law it is required that each municipality when making decisions concerning young people er they have to hear young people first they have responsibility of xx x contact with young people and on listening what they have to say and that said er it's not enough that we have this law we also have to know how to 
POwsd372:146	S4:	 use it 
POwsd372:147	S2:	 use this and and and create er the the methods the municipalities to use and that's the ma- in the in the process of making but at least young people have right to require that they will be heard in matters concerning them and that is covering whole finnish society

POwsd372:165	S1:	 er in that respect is there anything that you think youth organizations contribute to for example

POwsd372:167	SX-m:	 x xx

POwsd372:275	S5:	 er for example we are demanding that er er norwegian counties er take in one student worker for every thousand er er popu- every thousand in population and making concrete demands you know to to lessen er the missing student workers' places 
POwsd372:276	S1:	 is that a law or a practice or 
POwsd372:277	S4:	 a demand 
POwsd372:278	S5:	 it it it could be a demand for a law

POwsd372:301	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd372:302	S8:	 or if er when er if a if a student must w- if student must work it must be in erm yeah yeah for training 
POwsd372:303	SX-4:	 yeah that's what we said 
POwsd372:304	S8:	 for example for instance but not just to have money because 
POwsd372:305	SX-4:	 xx 
POwsd372:306	S8:	 in that case er i- er that's what happened in belgium er many the most of the student worker are poor students who must work to have s- money money and not in the pedagogical way so 
POwsd372:307	S5:	 mhm 
POwsd372:308	S8:	 it's er er it's not a step to xxx i think 
POwsd372:309	S5:	 yeah now all the way er when i say student worker er at least the way the way it works in in in my country is that 
POwsd372:310	S4:	 x x

POwsd372:325	S8:	 yeah we got in it 
POwsd372:326	S8:	 i don't er i don't have the same definition of student worker 
POwsd372:327	SX-f:	 mhm

POwsd372:339	S1:	 hm 
POwsd372:340	S1:	 so then er then we should try to find a concept that would er would be clear for for all national realities no

POwsd372:342	S8:	 x x xxx 
POwsd372:343	S4:	 @
POwsd372:344	S8:	 er maybe 
POwsd372:345	S1:	 er 
POwsd372:346	S8:	 xx we speak about er er s- paid trainings so to pay the to pay the trainings to give er 
POwsd372:347	SX-4:	 okay

POwsd372:349	S8:	 er er to to to to give a pay to the train- trainees maybe 
POwsd372:350	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwsd372:351	S1:	 thi- this is also something that is er tackled in the in the policy paper as well yeah 
POwsd372:352	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd372:353	S8:	 i think it's er that stands in er in the policy paper 
POwsd372:354	SX-m:	 yeah but 
POwsd372:355	S1:	 so that's basically we the the the idea from the policy paper is and i'm xxxizing a little bit is to stop this internship generation of young people yeah who are going from one internship to another and working in very precarious conditions internships that are not being recognized 
POwsd372:356	SX-8:	 yeah 
POwsd372:357	S1:	 internships for which they are not paid or paid not enough money which cannot even er allow them to er afford paying for for their accommodation er and and food very ba- very basic needs 
POwsd372:358	SX-5:	 hm 
POwsd372:359	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd372:360	S1:	 erm so er this could be something that would go so in line with with the paper we could say for national legislation that would er ensure er training or 
POwsd372:361	S5:	 but what is the word for it in english i mean there must be a word for it er for example if you're studying to become a hairdresser 
POwsd372:362	SX-f:	 mhm

POwsd372:364	S5:	 you have a couple of years er in school 
POwsd372:365	S1:	 it's vocational 
POwsd372:366	S5:	 a- and then you have one year of practice or what do you call it

POwsd372:369	SX-f:	 x

POwsd372:396	S9:	 yes er exactly 
POwsd372:397	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwsd372:398	S9:	 and they use the word placement 
POwsd372:399	S3:	 in belgium it's 
POwsd372:400	S3:	 mhm 
POwsd372:401	S9:	 because they are at school but they are placed in this particular company to get training 
POwsd372:402	S1:	 well placement training and x x xx 
POwsd372:403	S10:	 can you just come back and comment on on your state- er statement about the internship you said something like stop the internship generation because it's erm er not paid enough or the living conditions and blah blah blah but maybe i'm wrong er please correct me because i'm not i'm living in europe for one year @@ er as far as i found out till now that internship are actually more appreciated than voluntary work they are more better recognized 
POwsd372:404	SX-f:	 xx 
POwsd372:405	S10:	 so i really don't agree with the thing that we have to act er against it or to stop it or 
POwsd372:406	S12:	 er no 
POwsd372:407	S1:	 no x ju- just to clarify the question was not to say no to the internships because of course they con- they constitute er an experience 
POwsd372:408	SX-m:	 yah 
POwsd372:409	S10:	 but the but the condition of xxxx 
POwsd372:410	S1:	 but the better conditions when one gets an internship yah because 
POwsd372:411	S10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:412	S1:	 being an intern sometimes in a in a in a company in a even in n g os huh it happens i mean thank god not in the youth forum but er er but it's a reality to be an intern to maybe er do the same work as an assistant for example 
POwsd372:413	SX-10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:414	S1:	 but not to get paid the same kind of money and the fact that being an intern only guarantees a a usually a very very low circular wage or 
POwsd372:415	SX-10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:416	S1:	 very low amount of money which does not allow you to to live properly to
POwsd372:417	S10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:418	S1:	 but it is it is a type of work that is that is done 
POwsd372:419	SX:	 mhm 
POwsd372:420	S1:	 and i mean and and being recognized is not just a matter of recognizing it afterwards in terms of value but also recognizing while it's done and you recognize also by paying it properly and by no i mean 
POwsd372:421	S10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:422	S1:	 ensuring a certain 
POwsd372:423	S10:	 mhm 
POwsd372:424	S1:	 a certain condition it was in in this in this kind of view that er 
POwsd372:425	S10:	 okay 
POwsd372:426	S1:	 that this this point was was included in the in the paper but er 
POwsd372:427	S12:	 x 
POwsd372:428	S1:	 i think we this er you had something here that we we could we we could use here in our list of demands no er er the question of er of recognizing also the 
POwsd372:429	S12:	 voluntary work 
POwsd372:430	S10:	 the voluntary work 
POwsd372:431	S1:	 voluntary work and er and all kinds of previous experiences no so

POwsd372:433	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwsd372:434	SX-12:	 mhm 
POwsd372:435	S1:	 kind of er 
POwsd372:436	SX-m:	 xx 
POwsd372:437	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwsd372:438	S12:	 i mentioned some things that were said this morning that we could also add erm this morning we were talking about the transition process and erm maybe a demand could be that services or support services are created in terms of the transition process erm so that the that when transition starts there's no such pressure cos you're lost so there's much more preparation in terms for it 
POwsd372:439	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd372:440	S12:	 so that when someone finishes university or or finishes secondary er or whatever they don't they they are more prepared for the real world so to speak 
POwsd372:441	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd372:442	S12:	 so that's it could be sort of a some x it's a project or or i don't know but that a support system is created for youth 
POwsd372:443	SX:	 or orientation 
POwsd372:444	S12:	 sorry 
POwsd372:445	SX:	 or orientation 
POwsd372:446	S1:	 bridge basic 
POwsd372:447	S12:	 mhm 
POwsd372:448	SX:	 x 
POwsd372:449	S1:	 so we create a support system to bridge the

POwsd372:452	S12:	 between education and and work 
POwsd372:453	SX-f:	 work yeah 
POwsd372:454	S1:	 i think he- here we can also take the point from er from [S7] on er on the need of er of infrastructure appropriate infrastructure

POwsd372:754	S6:	 and in the second hand in the second the second reason is that the woman that make the similar job that i have

POwsd372:763	S6:	 in the top of the ratio er ha- have the similar er number of woman and men maybe the enterprise forget this practice that because this practices are very general practice in all the countries

POwsd372:765	S2:	 hm

POwsd372:772	S2:	 and that's what we need we need to force the change when the change is done we can skip the quotas because that's that they have done their purpose but we need to force the quota because or fo- force the change because er it's it's always that the guys are they are they know they know their own sandbox they know where to look f- for the for the nice guy to be in the board of the the the of the corporate

POwsd372:776	S2:	 outside their own sandbox 
POwsd372:777	S4:	 yeah but 
POwsd372:778	S2:	 and they have to like broaden their view and that's why we need to enforce the change 
POwsd372:779	S10:	 erm to be a erm bit more aggressive we had a discussion okay it's about a total different topic but and i don't wanna bother you but the point is like also er we were trying to make er kind of white paper policy paper er like being more aggressive i mean i'm in favor of that attitude because then you can really show what you want but er towards institutions maybe they that thing can er kind of scare them and then they simply refuse because it's too big change so going maybe step by step is more secure way of succeeding 
POwsd372:780	S1:	 so should we tone it down a little bit erm no i don't know what no i xx know why i'm asking @@@

POwsd372:782	S5:	 er about quotas in the the boards er in norway a law was passed er some years ago er giving the enterprises a deadline within this year i think it's two thousand and seven erm the relationship men and women er in all enterprise boards sh- should be forty to sixty er that allows some flexibility there could be one guy more or one f- f- er woman more

POwsd372:788	S5:	 er if we er would never er force a change as you said it would take what three thousand years until er we had as many women as er men in the boards so and i believe it has a positive effect because er that er when er the enterprises has a demand within that date we have to achieve this goal then they would just simply start have to educate and er make er g- erm er good er women right and er so i'm in favor of er quota
