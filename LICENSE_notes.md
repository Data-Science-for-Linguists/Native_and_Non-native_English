# British National Corpus (BNC)
* The license for the BNC is very restrictive; it cannot be copied or distributed to others. I did talk to Lauren Collister about this license, though, and she told me that because of Fair Use, I could show small samples of the corpus or statistics about the corpus through my code. 
* The following comes from the corpus's licence
