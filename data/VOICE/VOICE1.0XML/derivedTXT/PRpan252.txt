PRpan252:1	S1:	 xx has actually today we have talked a lot and we have listened to so many lectures about the hh content and language integration learning integrated learning er content-based instruction means the presentation of coherent and meaningful information hh leads to deeper processing that we want from our students to think about and to produce the language as much as they could and because if we believe that it results in a ve- b- a ver- very good and better er learning and er it also means the information hh and information that has a greater number of connections to related information promotes better hh learning and er facts and skills taught in isolation need much more practice and rehearsal before they can be internialized and the put into the long-term memory hh and also it is a development of the wider range of this course of skills than just traditional language instruction because er as er i said before it is er the connection of the language and the content so not only for the sake of the language but also making the students er hh er become aware of the content er be can different language and content-based activities er have the possibility of leading to flow experiences hh and er optimal experiences that emerge when personal skills are matched by high challenge hh it also provides the four cognitive engagement cases that are interesting and cognitively engaging will lead to more and better approachxx as for second language learning or acquisition this is especially very very important actually for our students to to catch the hh success okay so where is the problem so we are trying to give the er content and the language at the same time hh however the problem ser- seems to be coming from or resulting from the fact that hh er content teachers and the language teachers hh usually try to teach whatever or they'll field is so the language teachers usually feel hh er not comfortable about giving the content and this is the same the content and it is the same the content teachers have the same doubt why they are er trying to teach something hh they have er they don't want to be in the language of structural point hh actually so comprehension and the strategies in application in the institutions hh can be ignored somehow h- however comprehension integration and the learning hh are very important triangle connecting very important things because er hh er comprehension really is very important if you want the students to hh to re- ac- acquire the language and to use it in the er wanted or er desired er level because er natural language acquisition occurs in content it is not occurring in the unconnected circumstances hh therefore in the cognitive theories skills are are knowledge are formed in three stages those are the cognitive stage associative stage and the autonom stage what they are hh when we talk about the cognitive stage actually we mean that er students become aware of the fragments and they concentrate on the meaning whatever they have in their mind and er there try to connect er the within the realization and solution of basic problems with the language and the concepts hh however one step further in the associative stage they er realize their mistakes errors and they they start er thinking much more deeply er deeper and then hh they er we see that that knowledge and also the skills er become integrated one step further in the other stage so deeper forms of activated automatically and er the cognitive skills are developed to problem solving and er after these stages the models become very important for the students to develop confidence and er competence and er those are the shattered model adjust model and team-based model so in belarus we are planning to have the team-based model what they are if we have a look at very briefly [name1] says that er er the models in three groups as the shattered model to prepare students with special assistance for the same content materials as regular foreign language learners of students so they are erm acquiring the language itself in the adjust model th- the er it is a kind of preparing learners for mainstream classes where they will get the skills actually and th- the team-based model so this time we prepare the learners by content specixx by the teachers on a mainstream course such as introduction to tourism so our purpose is to be able to prepare the material for our students and there to learn language and the content at the same time so our students in belarus state economic university er the students in tourism and international relation departments and these students are learning er turkish as their third foreign language and er students er language level is not considered taken into consideration because they are the first beginners they are just beginners and they are taking their courses twice a week it is just two hours or three hours a week hh and our approach is based on their self-assessment in relation to their competence in language and content so we are planning to have the units according to their needs and er each unit for example is planned er to take er one or two weeks and er the aim is to allow students to explore various aspects of tourism while studying tourism and er at the end we ask them to prepare a kind of group project designing whatever they are required to do throughout the year curriculum okay because er we especially have chosen the students in the tourism department because turkey is very well known country about tourism and students are th- required to have the work er in different countries in belarus therefore students are preferring their er pf- third language as turkish because they can do their theoretical study and also pedagogical experience there hh and also students might have a future career so er my being here is er to get the you know a kind of er @ r- recommendation or comment about er what- -ever we can do for the benefits of our students in belarus actually therefore we tried to prepare something that what we are planning to do a kind of curriculum designed for the team-based er content-based instruction so those are the er units that we are planning for the following year for our students so it is the tourism types of tourism advertising and arranging counselling places to stay to see and eat and also at the end er a kind of project work actually so as i said before our er target within s- students are the beginner level students and er in the activity types er we will integrate language and the content and also the integrated skills like reading speaking listening and writing and as the background er the students have the knowledge in belarusian and russian since they are in the er tourism department those are the hh second grade students which means they have already had the knowledge about tourism as the introduction of tourism before and objectives are to help them to to use the language with the er vocabulary and the concepts and er to be able to re- reflect their critical thinking hh er abilities and er students will have the opportunities to express their ideas on tourism through the materials that we could er prepare for them when we have a look at the the skills briefly what we expect them to do is as the listening speaking reading and writing are those at the end this is that's the language course so er they will be assigned and er evaluated through the assessments et cetera but er those are basically based on the tourism field that they are studying i'd like to make it short as much as possible because er you are tired @@ i- i it's a very long @@ day very intensive day very fruitful day okay so that's it what i'd like to talk about er i know it's
