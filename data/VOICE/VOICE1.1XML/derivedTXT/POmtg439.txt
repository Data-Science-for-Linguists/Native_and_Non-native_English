POmtg439:51	S1:	 xxxxxxx 
POmtg439:52	S2:	 oh 
POmtg439:53	S9:	 the same question ah 
POmtg439:54	S2:	 xxxxx 
POmtg439:55	S9:	 the same question we discussed with [S6] because people keep calling and asking how they how can they learn english not paying money 
POmtg439:56	SX-f:	 @@@
POmtg439:57	SX-f:	 @@@
POmtg439:58	S9:	 i mean it's the politic people council city council people they don't pay not not a penny not one bit they have courses that i teach them but it's free it's another project 
POmtg439:59	S2:	 of course they don't 
POmtg439:60	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg439:61	S3:	 of course they don't 
POmtg439:62	S2:	 well 
POmtg439:63	S9:	 and here in this project i know just i asked [S6] whether courses are expensive in spain because they are totally expensive in lithuania 
POmtg439:64	S2:	 er 
POmtg439:65	S9:	 and people keep that's why people keep calling that's why people are interested in that 
POmtg439:66	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:67	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:68	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:69	S2:	 i mean that's i suppose it depends this is again a question of how people can motivate themselves to learn on their own 
POmtg439:70	S9:	 oh yes yes 
POmtg439:71	S2:	 or in groups of people but they then pay somebody 
POmtg439:72	SX-f:	 xxx 
POmtg439:73	S2:	 between them which would be cheaper 
POmtg439:74	S9:	 yes 
POmtg439:75	S2:	 so i mean certainly this next project what i'm doing is looking at that idea of people gathering together and actually taking responsibility for 
POmtg439:76	S9:	 yes 
POmtg439:77	S9:	 mhm 
POmtg439:78	S2:	 themselves which of course they need a lot of motivation to do that 
POmtg439:79	S9:	 oh yes 
POmtg439:80	S2:	 but in a way to make everything free is an illusion really since you can't keep 
POmtg439:81	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:82	S2:	 doing things for free but you can help them find ways things for less money for example say hh they could work with some of your students i mean like you use students from your institution 
POmtg439:83	S9:	 okay 
POmtg439:84	S9:	 yes yes i use students a lot yes 
POmtg439:85	S2:	 because you could use students and then maybe they get paid a little bit or the people you know give them a little bit of money 
POmtg439:86	S9:	 yeah 
POmtg439:87	S2:	 so but i think this is this is an issue that it's worth being discussed at some point about 
POmtg439:88	S3:	 yes 
POmtg439:89	S9:	 mhm 
POmtg439:90	S2:	 you know people do want things for free but sometimes people value things more if they pay for it 
POmtg439:91	S6:	 or they xx money 
POmtg439:92	S4:	 yes 
POmtg439:93	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:94	S2:	 you've got

POmtg439:367	S4:	 you know no one can speak our language huh then we explain and we will do it et cetera that's the- some because 
POmtg439:368	S2:	 so within luxembourg what proportion of people who are luxembourgish speak luxembourgish 
POmtg439:369	S4:	 i will say that a third of er luxembourg of residents of inhabitants of luxembourg a a third are real luxembourgish couple a third are mixed couple and a third is completely foreigners

POmtg439:378	S2:	 it's just an interesting scenario because you are not allowed to promote it and yet in a sense it's more important than promoting french or

POmtg439:423	S2:	 but you know there's obviously a re- there's obviously a real need 
POmtg439:424	S1:	 that's why you're targeting luxembourgish 
POmtg439:425	S2:	 to at least in a sense it's a shame that luxembourgish is an is an official language cos if it wasn't for example in ireland they are allowed to promote irish because it's not an official language it doesn't have 
POmtg439:426	S4:	 ah 
POmtg439:427	S3:	 oh

POmtg439:440	S4:	 no no 
POmtg439:441	S2:	 was interested in xx 
POmtg439:442	S4:	 er what we have also er all would like this thought they they really like the the the initiative they say it's really really good initiative hh the the they they say er it it's a good way you know to be er interested by languages erm they fill the the doc- the documentation the form the evaluation form in fact they didn't fill themself because they are so busy er and then the one who stay there you know 
POmtg439:443	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg439:444	S4:	 they take maybe ten fifteen twenty minutes to stay to talk to to drink et cetera but after they would like to go 
POmtg439:445	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg439:446	S4:	 and then i fill for them i ask them what is your opinion of this and i explain quickly and this this i fill for them

POmtg439:448	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:449	SS:	 mhm 
POmtg439:450	S4:	 this i think i- er important because also hh they don't unders- it's terrible the people the the they are they are able to read but they don't understand you know what is some er there is a problem 
POmtg439:451	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:452	S4:	 a lot of people they read and they don't understand what they read 
POmtg439:453	S3:	 is that what's what you're asking 
POmtg439:454	S4:	 then if you say the same thing but we explain a little what is the purpose of this question they give you one two three four and then you you do yourself 
POmtg439:455	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg439:456	S2:	 yeah yeah i know this 
POmtg439:457	S4:	 then the teacher in this case should do it 
POmtg439:458	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:459	S4:	 because i did it lot hh erm er the spanish was there to speak spanish 
POmtg439:460	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:461	S4:	 and my new staff because er one start first of september another one start first of july hh but the one who start in september he came also for the event just to see how it works and help us and at the beginning they didn't fill but after they fill because they say it's important 
POmtg439:462	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:463	S2:	 mhm

POmtg439:465	S2:	 mhm i can see that it can be a difficult situation like that yeah 
POmtg439:466	S1:	 but xxx depends on the nature of the activity if you have an activity like that it's much easier to to fill out evaluation forms 
POmtg439:467	S4:	 you must 
POmtg439:468	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:469	S1:	 whereas what i did was i i sent emails to people afterwards and they returned the forms to me that was yeah

POmtg439:489	S4:	 ah but i i didn't sh- er 
POmtg439:490	S2:	 oh yeah

POmtg439:492	S4:	 so this part you remember this part here
POmtg439:493	S1:	 oh yes but so will you try and send that to them and 
POmtg439:494	S4:	 i i i think 
POmtg439:495	S1:	 you haven't 
POmtg439:496	S4:	 yes 
POmtg439:497	S1:	 okay 
POmtg439:498	S4:	 we we ask them are you interested to a- another session because we will do luxembourgish we'll do ger- er english 
POmtg439:499	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg439:500	S4:	 er do you want to s- er receive the f- the brochure the fil- leaflet in french and do you want to have info about er training
POmtg439:501	S1:	 yeah

POmtg439:503	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:504	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:505	S4:	 and most of them because we put what the different domain they they they they say i would like to have information on this oh no it's not necessary hh we sent offer or proposal to them to all hh and we had er not completely a a a a feedback i'm not sure that we we hh have organized courses with this person for the moment they are still waiting hh but they have not say no they are not say yes er but we had an impact er to othe- cost- new customers 
POmtg439:506	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:507	S4:	 because they have seen the public- the advertisement in the supermarket on something some- somewhere they called to have spanish courses and we had i will say erm new courses new spanish courses er more in the country not in luxembourg town but more in the country we had people who contact us to have courses and i think it's not by the way you know like like it's not 
POmtg439:508	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:509	S4:	 because it was bizarre we didn't had before and it was just you know in august or in july hh erm we had also people who say i would like to be invited for luxembourgish erm

POmtg439:511	S4:	 @@@
POmtg439:512	S6:	 you are invited @@
POmtg439:513	S4:	 and then er s- er one association luxembourgish association in arlon would like to be also invited for the session and it's is i think the result of this because i- they they hear i contact them two years ago they don't want to speak with me and now they accept to speak with me they have seen the local pe- newspaper or something et cetera 
POmtg439:514	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:515	S4:	 erm 
POmtg439:516	S2:	 good yeah i think it's sometimes more difficult when you are a private organization i know definitively our spanish partners in the last project were a private school and they h- they had much more difficulty committing people in public 
POmtg439:517	S6:	 yeah 
POmtg439:518	S6:	 yeah 
POmtg439:519	S4:	 yes

POmtg439:522	S4:	 yes 
POmtg439:523	S2:	 you're having to work with that perhaps other people you know could say i'm from the university and we go oh yes that's fine 
POmtg439:524	S6:	 mhm 
POmtg439:525	S4:	 yes

POmtg439:527	S3:	 suspicious 
POmtg439:528	S6:	 yeah it's true 
POmtg439:529	S2:	 what do you want from us do you want money and it took them a long time to convince it was the library they were working with

POmtg439:531	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:532	S3:	 mhm

POmtg439:537	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:538	S2:	 and said here's a room you can use it no questions so i think this is something that hh you probably have to work 
POmtg439:539	S3:	 yes 
POmtg439:540	S4:	 yes 
POmtg439:541	S2:	 hard on that 
POmtg439:542	S4:	 that i will mention also in the report that i t- it is it is difficult also to to because it'll be interesting to c- to work also with different organization 
POmtg439:543	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg439:544	S4:	 but er the same organization as we are they don't want to work with you because who will have the

POmtg439:751	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:752	S2:	 and also it's very nice that it's going to slovakia or to spain but in a sense

POmtg439:865	S3:	 yes 
POmtg439:866	S5:	 so first of all we chose romanian language because there is an an increasing number of romanians living in portugal and we thought it would be interesting for people to know 
POmtg439:867	S3:	 oh 
POmtg439:868	S5:	 more about their member country 
POmtg439:869	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:870	S5:	 i think and er also because it's a latin language 
POmtg439:871	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:872	S5:	 i thought it would be more interesting also for people to participate than to learn er a language which they never had heard before 
POmtg439:873	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg439:874	S5:	 so after we erm we decided the romanian language we contact the embassy to know about teachers and cookers and everything they were very interested and they decided to participate and to to provide the teachers and the cooker after that we went for to to find a place to do it we decided to do it in a restaurant because we thought if i- it was er a quick er dinner like thirty minutes or something it will be not much for people to retain the information especially because it's a language that t- they never heard before so we decided to to to find a restaurant and to do a a proper dinner yes 
POmtg439:875	S2:	 oh right 
POmtg439:876	S5:	 er we talked with the cooker and she told us more or less what she was going to do and then we found a restaurant which was big enough to to put everybody 
POmtg439:877	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:878	S5:	 erm this we did a newsletter which is this 
POmtg439:879	SX-f:	 mhm

POmtg439:881	S5:	 which explains everything that we we were going to do over there erm we decided forty people it was the maximum because of the budget 
POmtg439:882	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:883	S5:	 we said forty people 
POmtg439:884	S2:	 lovely 
POmtg439:885	S5:	 erm then in in we we we had we've been going there er several times with the cooker to prepare everything we made the decoration with romanian er handicraft and er pictures erm then when we we decided to send this newsletter one month before yeah so people were were se- s- er sending m- messages to a x yeah we sent to members of our school of the embassy and of the restaurant we sended and then people started er sending back and er making reservations hh we didn't say i- if there was a prize so people didn't know at all 
POmtg439:886	S3:	 @@
POmtg439:887	S5:	 erm we had more or less fifty- -five people per ro- and room

POmtg439:890	S1:	 yeah

POmtg439:893	S5:	 it would be interesting again 
POmtg439:894	S2:	 and you go @@@@@@

POmtg439:896	S2:	 yeah

POmtg439:930	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:931	S2:	 it's marvellous 
POmtg439:932	S5:	 erm everybody g- got er very interested in new events like this and everybody liked a lot this because there were th- they didn't know what they were going for you know because i- is not that a known culture and er they thought the food was very similar to portuguese food 
POmtg439:933	S2:	 ah 
POmtg439:934	S5:	 something was s- similar and they liked a lot an- the the the language also and they were they thought it it was very interesting and but er probably the- they ar- were interested by the language but i don't know if they were g- g- going to learn more about it because th- most of the things that people were saying was that er it would be interesting to take this if you travel you know but since is it it's not a a language that has 
POmtg439:935	S10:	 economic 
POmtg439:936	S5:	 economic interest probably there aren't many people

POmtg439:939	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg439:940	S5:	 probably 
POmtg439:941	S2:	 it was it was more the experience of the day 
POmtg439:942	S5:	 yes yes yes but everybody took the boo- yeah took the booklet 
POmtg439:943	S2:	 and learning something 
POmtg439:944	S2:	 yeah 
POmtg439:945	S5:	 and now that they know that at least it's very similar culture than ours and then 
POmtg439:946	S5:	 the- th- they were keen to participate in another er 
POmtg439:947	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:948	S5:	 it's sad to do erm an event like this of a less known language if people doesn't have a special interest in it 
POmtg439:949	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:950	S5:	 because e- erm to learn more about the language or it's old pe- people at fifty-five or something years old that have a lot of time and they not they they want to learn more languages 
POmtg439:951	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg439:952	S5:	 otherwise people only go for the la- mo- the most known languages

POmtg439:955	S2:	 mhm 
POmtg439:956	S5:	 it's hard to do that

POmtg439:959	S3:	 i- it doesn't matter does it mhm mhm 
POmtg439:960	S2:	 the way you you did the event in a sense the objective wasn't to get people to learn romanian

POmtg439:963	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:964	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg439:965	S2:	 but it sounds like what i loved about your event was that people really took notice of the language and the culture and make comparisons with their own and discovered something that they really hadn't known about

POmtg439:973	S2:	 didn't know it was a romance language
