1. Contents
-----------

This package includes the XML data files and additional material of
the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE). It
comprises four data sets.

- The first data set, VOICE 1.0 XML, corresponds to the data that was
  published via the web platform VOICE Online
  <http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/> on 2009-05-22.

- The second data set, VOICE 1.1 XML, corresponds to the data that was
  published via the web platform VOICE Online
  <http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/> on 2011-05-05. It includes minor
  revisions and corrections that were made between 2011-01-24 and
  2011-04-22.

- The third data set, VOICE 2.0 XML, corresponds to the data that was
  published via the web platform VOICE Online
  <http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/> on 2013-01-22. It includes minor
  revisions and corrections that were made between 2012-07-02 and
  2012-07-31.

- The fourth data set, VOICE POS XML 2.0, is the first part-of-speech
  tagged and lemmatized version of the corpus. It corresponds to the
  data on VOICE POS Online 2.0, which was published and is accessible
  via the web platform VOICE Online <http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/>
  on 2013-01-22. It also corresponds to the data of VOICE 2.0 XML (see
  above), however including a number of differences in the encoding
  scheme (see section 4).

3. Structure
------------

/VOICE1.0XML

Contains all files specific to the version 1.0 of VOICE XML. Note that
this version aligns with all research done on the basis of VOICE
Online before 5 May 2011. In this folder you will find three
sub-folders: XML, derivedHTML, derivedTXT. The XML folder contains all
full corpus files of VOICE 1.0 XML. One corpus-header.xml with shared
meta-data and general information on the corpus and 151 individual
corpus files corresponding to the 151 corpus texts. The file names are
indicative of the domain and speech event type of the particular event
(e.g. EDcon4.xml). This format is described under 7. NAMING
RULES. Additionally, two derived versions of the corpus are provided
in HTML and plain TXT format in the corresponding folders, derivedTXT
and derivedHTML. Please refer to the README files in the respective
folders for information on the limitations of these derived versions
of the corpus.

/VOICE1.1XML

Contains all files specific to the revised version 1.1 of VOICE. Note
that this version aligns with research done on the basis of VOICE
Online from 5 May 2011 until 22 January 2013. The folder structure
follows the same principles as described in VOICE1.0XML above.

/VOICE2.0XML

Contains all files specific to the revised version 2.0 of VOICE. Note
that this version aligns with research done on the basis of VOICE
Online from January 2013. The folder structure follows the same
principles as described in VOICE1.0XML above. This edition of VOICE
XML is recommended for future research, as it includes further
revisions in some of the corpus texts.

/VOICEPOSXML2.0

This folder includes a part-of-speech (POS) tagged and lemmatized
version of the corpus. Note that this version aligns with research
done on the basis of VOICE POS Online from January 2013. In this
folder you will find two sub-folders: XML and derivedTXT. The XML
folder contains all corpus files of VOICE 2.0 XML, one
corpus-header.xml with shared meta-data and general information on the
corpus and 151 individual corpus files corresponding to the 151 corpus
texts. The folder derivedTXT contains a derived (tab-separated) text
version of the tagged corpus. The file names are indicative of the
domain and speech event type of the particular
event(e.g. EDcon4.xml). This format is described under section
7. NAMING RULES.


/schema

Contains the definition of the schema derived from the Text Encoding
Initiative Guidelines P5 (TEI P5) and the documentation of the
schema. The schema is a subset of elements defined in TEI P5 with
minor additions to suit the requirements for the encoding of
VOICE. The definition of the schema as well as the documentation of
features that were added to standard TEI P5 is specified using the TEI
ODD vocabulary (see <http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml>).
The files VOICESchema.rng and VOICESchema.rnc can be used with an
RelaxNG validator to ensure the validity of the corpus files. Many XML
editors have built-in facilities for this, but in any case James
Clark's freely available jing package can be used for this purpose
(see <http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html>). The schema is
accompanied by a documentation in PDF format. This PDF file is
directly generated from the ODD specification, that is, it is the
result of merging the documentation as provided by the TEI Council
with the documentation of VOICE's custom elements, using the official
TEI tool roma2. We gratefully acknowledge the work of all contributors
to the TEI Guidelines (see <http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5>).

The schema does not include the description for VOICE POS XML. VOICE
POS XML is a schema which displays the POS-tags with featurestructures
on word-level.

/contrib

Contains code that can be used to process VOICE. The files in this
folder are provided for your convenience to give you code examples on
how to pre-process the corpus files to suit your specific needs. The
XSLT-Stylesheets you find here were used to prepare the derivedTXT and
derivedHTML versions of the corpus.


4. Differences between VOICE XML, VOICE Online and VOICE POS
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe the differences between the encoding
schemata of VOICE XML, VOICE Online and VOICE POS means of
example. That is, the representation differences of individual
features in the three versions are listed. Obviously this is not a
normative reference, but should help users accustomed to working with
one version of the corpus to get started with another version.  If not
indicated otherwise, "VOICE POS" refers to both the XML and the
derivedTXT version of the part-of-speech and lemmatized version of the
corpus. Due to the practical issues in the tokenization and tagging
procedure only pure text, pauses and laughter were extracted, which
means that some additional mark-up, e.g. overlaps or emphasis, is
either not represented in the VOICE POS versions, or represented
differently, as is the case for e.g. anonymization (for details, see
the individual subsections below).


Vocabularies:

In XML, vocabularies, that is sets of tags, can be distinguished by
namespaces. The default namespace for the documents in VOICE XML is
the TEI namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0". For additions to the
TEI schema, the VOICE XML specific namespace
"http://www.univie.ac.at/voice/ns/1.0" is used with the prefix
"voice". In the descriptions below <u> would refer to the TEI XML
element with the name "u" whereas <voice:to> refers to the VOICE XML
specific element with the name "to".

Conventions:

To set attribute names apart from the descriptive text, they are
prefixed with an "@" symbol (@voice:desc). Similarly, XML Element
names are always surrounded by pointy brackets (<seg>). The term
'pseudo-XML notation' refers to mark-up in VOICE Online that resembles
XML elements in that it uses a start < > and end </ > tag.

The Subsections in this section follow this format:

- Example in VOICE Online format
- Brief description of this example
- Corresponding example in VOICE XML format
- Brief description of this example
- Corresponding example in VOICE POS
- Brief description of this example

All examples are minimal fragments that are reduced in order to focus
on the described feature. As these fragments are constructed examples,
they do not necessarily occur exactly in this form in the corpus.

  4.1. UTTERANCES
  ---------------
  S1: ...
  S2: ...
  
  In VOICE Online, utterances start with a 'sigle' (the speaker ID,
  e.g. S1:, S2:) and extend to the end of the text-block. The next
  sigle starts the next utterance.
  
  <u who="#EDcon4_S1"> <!-- ... --> </u>
  <u who="#EDcon4_S2"> <!-- ... --> </u>
  
  In VOICE XML and VOICE POS XML utterances are contained within <u>
  elements. The attribute @who contains a corresponding form of the
  speaker's sigle.
  
  EDcon4_11:2

  In the derivedTXT version of VOICE POS, utterances are not framed by
  a <u> element but each token is listed vertically in a line, being
  preceded by an element which indicates event ID (EDcon4), utterance
  number (_11) and position of the token in the utterance
  (:2). Utterances are separated by a space line.

  4.2. INTONATION
  ---------------
  my next er slide?
  absolutely yes. 
  
  In VOICE Online, intonation is represented by "?" (rising) and "."
  (falling).
  
  my next er slide<c type="intonation" function="rise"/>
  absolutely yes<c type="intonation" function="fall"/>
  
  In VOICE XML, intonation is represented by the <c> element. The
  attribute @type is set to "intonation" while the attribute @function
  indicates rising ("rise") and falling ("fall") intonation.
  
  my next er slide
  absolutely yes 

  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate intonation.
  
  
  4.3. EMPHASIS
  -------------
  a very IMPORTANT issue
  toMORrow we have to work on the
  
  In VOICE Online, particular emphasis on a syllable is indicated by
  uppercase letters.
  
  a very <emph>important</emph> issue
  to<emph>mor</emph>row we have to work on the
  
  In VOICE XML, emphasis is indicated by the <emph> element. The
  content of this element corresponds to the emphasised portion of
  speech. Note that only lowercase letters are used in VOICE XML.
 
  a very important issue
  tomorrow we have to work on the
 
  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate emphasis.
  

  4.4. PAUSES
  -----------
  give me different (.) different (.) points
  aha (2) so finally 
  
  In VOICE Online, pauses are indicated by parentheses. The
  parentheses contain either a "." for a brief pause or a number
  indicating the duration of the pause in seconds.
  
  give me different <pause/> different </pause> points
  aha <pause dur="PT2S"/>
  
  In VOICE XML, pauses are indicated by the <pause> Element. The
  attribute @dur indicates the duration in W3C format (see the TEI
  Guidelines: 8.3.2 Pausing).
  
  give me different _0 different _0 points
  aha _2 so finally 

  In VOICE POS, pauses are represented by an underscore ("_") followed
  by a numeral (zero for a brief pause or a number greater than zero
  indicating duration of the pause to approximate seconds)
  
  

  4.5. OVERLAPS
  -------------
  it is your best <1> case </1> scenario
  <1> yeah </1>
  
  In VOICE Online, overlaps are indicated by a pseudo-XML notation
  with a number (e.g. <1> </1>). The overlapping portions of speech
  can be identified by the corresponding numbers.
  
  it is your best <seg n="1" type="overlap" xml:id="EDcon999_ol_6"> case
  </seg> scenario
  
  <seg n="1" synch="#EDcon999_ol_6" type="overlap"
  xml:id="EDcon999_ol_7> yeah </seg>
  
  In VOICE XML, overlaps are indicated with the element <seg> and an
  attribute @type with the value "overlap". The corresponding numbers
  you find in VOICE Online are provided in the attribute @n. Every
  overlap carries a unique attribute @xml:id, which is referenced in
  the corresponding following overlaps in the @synch attribute.

  it is your best case scenario
  yeah
  
  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate overlaps. 
  

  4.6. OTHER-CONTINUATION

  <anchor xml:id="EDcon999_oc_1" synch="#EDcon999_oc_0"/> really
  
  In VOICE XML, other-continuation is indicated with the element
  <anchor> and attribute @type with the value
  "other_continuation". The attribute @xml:id is unique for every
  anchor and is used to establish the reference to the corresponding
  <anchor> with the attribute @synch.

  yes
  really

  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate other-continuation. 
    
  4.7. LENGTHENING

  to go t- t- to to this t- -ype
  
  Self-interruptions and incomplete words are indicated with "-" at
  the point of disruption, i.e. at the beginning or end of a word
  fragment. All three versions (VOICE Online, VOICE XML and VOICE POS) follow this rule.
  

  4.9. LAUGHTER
  -------------
  who knows @@
  <@> yeah </@> @@ that's right
  
  In VOICE Online, laughter is indicated by sequences of "@"

  indicated by surrounding the portion of speech with the pseudo-XML
  notation <@> </@>
  
  who knows <vocal type="wordlike" subtype="wordstart"
  voice:desc="laughing" voice:syl="2"/>

  <shift corresp="#EDcon999_s_4" feature="voice" new="laugh"

  ------------------
  <spel> j a r g o n </spel>
  
  In VOICE Online, words or abbreviations which are spelt out by the
  speaker are indicated with the pseudo-XML notation <spel>
  </spel>. The spaces between the letters indicate the boundaries of
  the spelling, that is either letters or clusters of letters.
  
  <w voice:mode="spelt"> j a r g o n </w>
  
  In VOICE XML, spelt words are contained in <w> elements with the
  attribute @voice:mode="spelt". The spaces indicate the boundaries of
  the spelling analogous to VOICE Online.
  
  s_jargon

  In VOICE POS, spelling is marked "s_" preceding the token.
  Boundaries in the spelling are not indicated.
  
  

  4.15. SPEAKING MODES
  --------------------
  in the <fast> universities of </fast> cyprus
  
  In VOICE Online, significant shifts in the speaking mode are
  indicated with pseudo-XML elements. The label in the tags (in the
  above example "fast") corresponds to the speaking mode.
  
  in the <shift feature="tempo" new="a" xml:id="EDcon999_s_5"/>

  xml:id="EDcon999_s_6" corresp="#EDcon999_s_5"/> cyprus
  
  In VOICE XML, speaking modes are indicated with the <shift>
  element. This is qualified with two attributes. The attribute
  @feature indicates which aspect is altered (e.g. tempo). The
  attribute @new indicates the newly assigned value. When shifting
  back to neutral, only the shift is reverted that is explicitly named
  in the attribute @corresp. For a list of occurring combinations of
  @feature and @new, refer to the VOICE corpus header (section

  --------------------
  yes <yawns>
  
  In VOICE Online, speaker noises are indicated by a label in pointy
  brackets.
  
  yes <vocal voice:desc="yawns"/>
  
  In VOICE XML, speaker noises are indicated with the element <vocal>
  (note: speaker noises also include those that are only
  semi-vocalised or qualify as non-verbal feedback). For a list of
  possible features encoded in the attribute @voice:desc, refer to the
  VOICE corpus header (section <tagUsage>).
  
  yes

  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate speaker noises.
  

  4.18. ANONYMIZATION
  -------------------
  oh [S6] is really good
  
  In VOICE Online, anonymization is given in square brackets. The
  label between the brackets indicates what is anonymized (ie. S1,
  S2/last, first name8, org1).
  
  oh <supplied reason="anonymization"> [S6] </supplied> is really good
  
  In VOICE XML, the element <supplied> with the attribute
  @reason="anonymization" is used to indicate anonymized parts. The
  text in the element (e.g. [S6]) follows the same format as the
  anonymizations in VOICE Online.
  
  oh a_[S6] is really good

  In VOICE POS, anonymization is given in square brackets, as in VOICE
  Online. The anonymization is additionally marked "a_" preceding the
  token.
  

  4.19. CONTEXTUAL EVENTS
  -----------------------
  {mobile rings}
  {S3 pours coffee (3)}

  interaction.
  
  <incident voice:desc="mobile rings"/>
  <incident voice:desc="S3 pours coffee" dur="PT3S"/>
  
  In VOICE XML, contextual events are indicated by the element
  <incident>. The attribute @voice:desc provides a description of the
  event and the optional attribute @dur gives the approximate duration
  in seconds in W3C format (see 4.4. Pauses).
  
  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate contextual events.

  4.20. PARALLEL CONVERSATIONS
  ----------------------------
  er <to S2> not quite isn't it </to S2>
  
  In VOICE Online, parallel conversations are indicated in pseudo-XML
  notation, where the tagname is composed of "to " and the sigle of
  the speaker the portion of speech is directed to.
  
  er <voice:to @who="#EDcon999_S1"> not quite isn't it </voice:to>
  
  In VOICE XML, the element <voice:to> is used to indicated parallel
  conversations. The mandatory attribute @who refers to the speaker
  the portion of speech is directed to.

  er not quite isn't it

  In VOICE POS, there is no mark-up to indicate parallel conversations.
  

  4.21. UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH
  ---------------------------
  we <un> xxx </un> for the
  the process will <un> x <ipa> θeɪŋ </ipa> </un>
  
  In VOICE Online, unintelligible speech is indicated with the <un>
  </un> pseudo-XML notation. The number of unintelligible syllables
  roughly corresponds to the number of "x" characters. Optionally, the
  <ipa> </ipa> pseudo-XML element provides a phonetic representation
  of the unintelligible portion of speech.
  
  we <supplied reason="unintelligible"> xxx </supplied> for the
  the process will <supplied reason="unintelligible" voice:ipa="θeɪŋ">
  x </supplied>
  
  In VOICE XML, unintelligible speech is indicated in the element
  <supplied> with the attribute @reason="unintelligible". The optional
  attribute @voice:ipa provides a phonetic representation of the
  unintelligible portion of speech.

  we xxx for the
  the process will x
  
  In VOICE POS, unintelligible speech is indicated by "x"-characters,
  the number of these corresponding to the number of syllables, as in
  VOICE Online. The phonetic transcription is never given for
  unintelligible speech.
    

  4.22. TRANSCRIPTION BORDERS
  ---------------------------
  (gap 00:06:36) {multiple parallel conversations, hardly intelligible}
  (nrec 00:00:45) {change of minidisk}
  
  In VOICE Online, omissions between blocks of transcription are
  indicated by in parentheses indicating a label for the reason of
  omission (i.e gap and nrec), a time marker indicating the duration
  and a description in curly brackets.
  
  <gap dur="PT00H06M36S" reason="not_transcribed" voice:desc="multiple
  parallel conversations, hardly intelligible"/>
  <gap dur="PT00H00H45S" reason="not_recorded" voice:desc="change of
  minidisk"/>
  
  In VOICE XML, contiguous blocks of sequential utterances are
  contained by <div> elements. Omissions between these elements are
  indicated by the <gap> element with the attribute @reason indicating
  "not_transcribed" (gap) or "not_recorded" (nrec) as the reason for
  the omission. The duration of the gap is encoded in the attribute
  @dur in W3C format (see 4.4. Pauses).
  
  In VOICE POS, omissions between blocks of transcription are not
  indicated.

  
5. Corpus Size 
--------------

Whereas in the XML versions the corpus size is given in terms of
'orthographically defined words' (with pauses and laughter not being
counted at all, items in spelt sequences counted as individual words,
e.g. "j a r g o n" counted as six words), for the POS versions the
units counted are tokens. This means that pauses and
laughter-sequences total one token, contractions and possessive
markers are counted as two tokens (e.g. he's = tokens "he" and "s",
teachers' = tokens "teacher" and "'") and spelt sequences are drawn
together and counted as one token, e.g. s_jargon.


6. Recommended Tools
--------------------

One of the objectives of the release of VOICE XML is to enhance the
researchers' flexibility by enabling them to use the tools that suit
their particular research projects. But increased flexibility also
implies increased complexity. To provide a starting point for your
enquiries, please consider one of the programs listed below for
working with VOICE XML and VOICE POS.


  6.1 Corpus Tools
  ------------------

  * Xaira <http://xaira.sourceforge.net> An XML Aware Indexer and
    Retrieval Architecture that can make use of the annotation for
    querying.

  * Wordsmith <http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith> (almost completely
    XML agnostic, but widely used).

  * GATE Tools <http://www.gate.ac.uk> General Architecture for Text
    Engineering. Framework that provides integration with many NLP
    tools.


  6.2 General Purpose Tools
  -------------------------

  * saxon <http://www.saxonica.com> General Purpose XML Stylesheet and
    XQuery processor.

  * BaseX <http://www.basex.org> XML Database that can be structurally
    queried with the XML Query Language.

  * eXist-db <http://www.exist-db.org> The XML Database VOICE Online
    uses as a back-end.

  * Oxygen <http://www.oxygenxml.com> XML Editor that can be used in
    combination with any of the above general purpose tools.


7. Naming Rules
---------------

The filenames for corpus texts in VOICE XML and VOICE POS follow the
definition of event IDs as they are used in VOICE Online. The event ID
specifies the domain the text is part of (two capital letters,
e.g. PR), the speech event type it represents (three lower case
letters, e.g. con), and combines this with a number that the text was
assigned to in the VOICE database (e.g. 29). The combination of these
specifications uniquely identifies the individual text in the corpus
(e.g. PRcon29.xml). For abbreviations and definitions of domains and
speech event types, see the file corpus-header.xml.

The following production rules in EBNF (see
<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation>) define the naming scheme
of the corpus files for VOICE:

corpus_file_name ::= domain speech-event-type ID file-type

domain ::= educational | leisure | professional_business |
          professional_organizational | professional_research

educational ::= "ED"

leisure ::= "LE"

professional_business ::= "PB"

professional_organisational ::= "PO"

professional_research ::= "PR"

speech-event-type ::= interview | press_conference | service_encounter |
                     seminar_discussion | working_group_discussion |
                     workshop_discussion | meeting | panel |
                     question-answer_session | conversation

interview ::= "int"

press_conference ::= "prc"

service_encounter ::= "svc"

seminar_discussion ::= "sed"

working_group_discussion ::= "wsd"

meeting ::= "mtg"

panel ::= "pan"

question-answer session ::= "qas"

conversation ::= "con"

ID ::= [0-9] [0-9]*

file_type ::= "xml" | "html" | "txt"
