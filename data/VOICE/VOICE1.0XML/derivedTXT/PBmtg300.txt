PBmtg300:330	S2:	 hey er just to explain you more about [org2] it's er last year it was a well let's say a struggle year er our performance was okay if you look to the total performance and i'm talking in er load factors is more er er well an average between the ninety and the ninety-two tons load factor and this is cumulalative back to january so it's still a pretty high performance even though you can see especially in the last year that well yieldwise it's a tremendous cutdown if you compare well you know you guys know especially also that er er the rates are going down tremendously and er well this this was a tough part of the year so especially if you know maybe the hongkong people they're very keen to keep levels up to a scenario which is actually not market-conform any more so in that way we are struggling a lot things you know er well to get those aggressive rates into the market you can notice also with with you guys because last half year er from the other year the two thousand and three erm well i lowered your rate in that concern to get you more car- mar- mar- market-conform rate to maybe attract some more business erm in that sense in the beginning i noticed your turnover some dubai even but there was more er more i believe overflow dubai if i say it correct from your s- from your side
PBmtg300:331	S3:	 er dubai it's dubai it's always difficult erm

PBmtg300:580	S3:	 oh 
PBmtg300:581	S2:	 erm in in holland erm our monday flight sometimes we try to er delay it in terms if it's possible commercialwise why because there's a tremendous market with er plants flowers to dubai in that sense er we build up even the flower option not the agents but the shippers and with those shippers which we know their agents they together try to succeed to fill the flight and actually that's a sort of xx chartering actually also their flight and just to know well lately it works out pretty good but then er well it's the timing because cut-off for flowers on a monday is is not a good day 
PBmtg300:582	S1:	 @ tuesday 
PBmtg300:583	S2:	 suppose it was a tuesday that's a brilliant day
PBmtg300:584	S1:	 yeah yes

PBmtg300:586	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:587	S1:	 yeah it's it's difficult 
PBmtg300:588	S2:	 so we are really looking desperately to have this flight on monday go into the tuesday but this is very tough especially with swippal with slots and whatever it's it's a tough decision

PBmtg300:617	S2:	 i don't i don't know but i i'll let you know the name of it we just had i believe it was in december we changed this whole schedule we added some destinations 
PBmtg300:618	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:619	S2:	 er better prices 
PBmtg300:620	S3:	 so you have as well that means you you can offer as well a a bonded trucking from dubai to riad and jiddah
PBmtg300:621	S2:	 er 
PBmtg300:622	S2:	 yes i believe so yes but i i need to check because i have now a total summamary of all the destinations including what is necessary 
PBmtg300:623	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:624	S2:	 you know er suppose it is not bonded or it is bonded whatever i can tell you immediately it's it's just 
PBmtg300:625	S3:	 yeah because i need to know the conditions because especially saudi arabia it's pretty difficult hh cos i know in in let's say in riad and jiddah they have no free zone available
PBmtg300:626	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:627	S2:	 even even 
PBmtg300:628	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:629	S3:	 that means usually the custom clearance needs to be done at the border already or already in dubai 
PBmtg300:630	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:631	S3:	 er which is making it pretty difficult for the for the consignees to obtain the cargo and it's as well higher costs involved
PBmtg300:632	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:633	S3:	 and the only free zone in saudi arabia is in damal
PBmtg300:634	S2:	 even even i can tell you now necessary documentation and what all all kinds of details
PBmtg300:635	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg300:636	S2:	 it's it i will explain to you it's a just a i make a copy of what we have here

PBmtg300:638	S2:	 uhu
PBmtg300:639	S3:	 might become might become more of interest 
PBmtg300:640	S2:	 xx 
PBmtg300:641	S2:	 cos last last time we had a very big shipment to i believe it was damal and there was something also with with bonded but actually what we did we we trucked it directly actually to the consignee
PBmtg300:642	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:643	S2:	 but the problem was he had no bonded warehouse xx but then we had some people also by this company and they arranged at the border that they already could clear it and then they could continue the whole thing
PBmtg300:644	S3:	 yeah but this is always a a cost factor
PBmtg300:645	S2:	 yeah okay but well 
PBmtg300:646	S3:	 cos if you if you can clear in a free zone er you're m- maybe a lot of companies are duty exemptors so they have to clear in the free zone 
PBmtg300:647	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:648	S3:	 er if they do clear their cargo at the border they might to have er to pay duties er whatsoever er which is quite expensive in saudi arabia

PBmtg300:999	S6:	 i might say it like that so far when i was working befor- with you because i had also a certain time the backup of [first name6] when she was taking care about the hongkong trophy hh i had er these big nice er shipment mainly you reminded it's wa- from portugal was this very 
PBmtg300:1000	S2:	 i don't know
PBmtg300:1001	S6:	 it's it was a dense cargo but it was not very nice to build up and so on

PBmtg300:1003	S6:	 and 
PBmtg300:1004	S1:	 mhm and i thought 
PBmtg300:1005	S6:	 it was in august 
PBmtg300:1006	S1:	 august yeah 
PBmtg300:1007	S6:	 august end of august i was er dealing with [first name10] about that
PBmtg300:1008	S2:	 hh and this this i remembered 
PBmtg300:1009	S6:	 and so far it was working very well i didn't didn't had any problems 
PBmtg300:1010	S1:	 it was this er eleven lower deck or something like this shipment er nightmare shipment
PBmtg300:1011	S6:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah correct
PBmtg300:1012	S6:	 because you could not er build it up on main deck because it was too heavy 
PBmtg300:1013	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1014	S2:	 oh you know at that time i t- i t- i traveled also a lot and er i was not really in the office at that time and i heard something between er concerning this er from portugal whatever but what i understood there was a a mixture of a mix-up of of rates which they give to you i believe and say to somebody else but i don't know who the other was i really don't know but i can find out more details if you prefer to hear it still in that kind of particular case 
PBmtg300:1015	S6:	 i think you took it over er but erm after that i didn't had any problems actually because i had a erm i had a 
PBmtg300:1016	S1:	 the problems was never with [org2] side 
PBmtg300:1017	S6:	 a certain number 
PBmtg300:1018	S1:	 there wa- there was 
PBmtg300:1019	S6:	 i had a certain number for your quotation which you gave me on this time 
PBmtg300:1020	S1:	 yeah yeah there there was was no hiccups er with er the the part from [org2] 
PBmtg300:1021	S6:	 in that way it was 
PBmtg300:1022	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1023	S1:	 it was internal with [org1] 
PBmtg300:1024	S6:	 but from the 
PBmtg300:1025	S6:	 okay that was something else 
PBmtg300:1026	S2:	 but ov- overall none of us got it what i believe we didn't either also got it er i believe your side you didn't get it so in that sense er @ it's nothing particular t- to tell you something
PBmtg300:1027	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1028	S2:	 suppose we we get inquiries er sometimes that happens we get the same inquiries which you have and we get them from out of germany belgium france whatever n- just name it
PBmtg300:1029	S1:	 sure 
PBmtg300:1030	S2:	 we always and i tell you this honestly always do the same rate always why because we want to avoid this kind of conflict
PBmtg300:1031	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1032	S1:	 absolutely
PBmtg300:1033	S2:	 and this this is really we'd erm put my hands into the fire for it this is the the scenario we only work because we want to make no conflicts and believe me this is the thing [org2] always does and we try to avoid always this kind of things
PBmtg300:1034	S6:	 that's that's er that's er normal but you never know what the origins er in these country are then in the end are offering let's say they are coming to you request a shipment for a special shipment
PBmtg300:1035	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1036	S6:	 you give the same rate like you gave it to us but they say erm er okay if i get this shipment maybe i can er pressure them down to 
PBmtg300:1037	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1038	S6:	 er that i get a better rate and then they're offering something lower and then you have already the hiccup as a as a origin so
PBmtg300:1039	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1040	S2:	 yeah that's something which we cannot help of course if if they lower if if they 
PBmtg300:1041	S6:	 sure 
PBmtg300:1042	S6:	 sure that's 
PBmtg300:1043	S2:	 put i don't know their commission lower or their whatever they put lower themselves well this this is a thing which is a well a thing which we cannot control
PBmtg300:1044	S6:	 sure
PBmtg300:1045	S2:	 but you know why why we do this particular with [org2] and i say again we we we really don't do this why w- we have learned you know if you look to a particular business in holland you have the flower and the plants business hh well believe me this is a a business which is you have a very big basket of cargo and all those flower agents around it they're jumping on this
PBmtg300:1046	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1047	S2:	 and if you say from hey er i like you better or or this lady is er is more beautiful than that lady whatever you give her a better price it doesn't work out because they around they will come back to you say hey [S2] er i don't believe it you gave her or you gave him a better price because of this
PBmtg300:1048	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1049	S2:	 so in that respect we learned from ourselves and said okay well er @ this is too much because at the end of all you'll be a referee it's it's it's it's incredible and in in that way we give everybody the same chance if ooph well a- a- again we still need to get the shipment also but 
PBmtg300:1050	S6:	 sure 
PBmtg300:1051	S2:	 we give them the same rates 
PBmtg300:1052	S1:	 hh 
PBmtg300:1053	S2:	 to make sure you don't hit this conflict in
PBmtg300:1054	S1:	 erm we like this and er that's the best way to do it erm just make sure er that er your offline stations 
PBmtg300:1055	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1056	S1:	 er are doing the same i mean er clear you have a rate ex amsterdam and you have a rate ex frankfurt which should be normally a hire rate 
PBmtg300:1057	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1058	S1:	 and not a common rate to amsterdam which often happens with er offline stations not only with [org2] but 
PBmtg300:1059	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1060	S2:	 yeah yeah i know i know 
PBmtg300:1061	S1:	 with x of things hh and also if you open your office in munich then then er for a special quotation you should offer ex amsterdam ex munich the same rate
PBmtg300:1062	S2:	 yah yah 
PBmtg300:1063	S1:	 and this you have to assure within your system cos otherwise exactly this game will start

PBmtg300:1191	S1:	 hh a lot of two hundreds are on the market but not four hundreds 
PBmtg300:1192	S2:	 yes well the three hundreds we want to buy also the classics and er again we have one on on on on side which is actually from [org22] airlines this is also something particular you know if if you look to [org2] which is chinese and taiwan this fourth actually is from that

PBmtg300:1278	S2:	 yes
PBmtg300:1279	S1:	 mhm
PBmtg300:1280	S2:	 and we are already having timings which er i believe was around eleven o'clock in the morning departure out of munich but ag- again [S1] this this is in an in an stadium because [first name13] and myself we believe that at day one is not a very good opportunity
PBmtg300:1281	S1:	 no 
PBmtg300:1282	S2:	 for well this this is a point of discussion which we are talking over with then hongkong at the moment try to have another day to avoid this day one why because already in amsterdam we have day one departure 
PBmtg300:1283	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1284	S2:	 suppose we have in munich day one departure well this this is er for europe is a tremendous lack of capacity which is er well it it's a loss if you put it in that way 
PBmtg300:1285	S1:	 you have already two problems here it not only the monday flight you have a problem 
PBmtg300:1286	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1287	S1:	 if you er er try to think you schedule a flight on a on day four 
PBmtg300:1288	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1289	S1:	 before lunch you have a next problem
PBmtg300:1290	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1291	S1:	 a lot of er the cargo a ma- majority of cargo in europe is concentrated in xx centers not only with [org5] [org24] [org25] wherever everybody with the same
PBmtg300:1292	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1293	S1:	 so the german cargo is in frankfurt 
PBmtg300:1294	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1295	S1:	 trucked out from the original branches on day three arriving frankfurt round about m- midnight and then they consolidate the same goes in austria
PBmtg300:1296	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1297	S1:	 everything goes to linz to vienna italy same same if you have then to build everything up and bring it to munich
PBmtg300:1298	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1299	S1:	 they make it earliest on thursday morning to truck out
PBmtg300:1300	S2:	 check okay 
PBmtg300:1301	S1:	 so if you go for an early uplift on day four hh the only er airline who can do this and survives this
PBmtg300:1302	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1303	S1:	 really i mean amsterdam is a little bit different market cos with a perishable market you can catch these flights and all this and and this is big fill-up 
PBmtg300:1304	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1305	S1:	 er is here in luxembourg [org26] simply the fact we get the same cargo over night to luxembourg
PBmtg300:1306	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1307	S1:	 otherwise they have a problem that's why also why [org27] airlines flights are only in the afternoon you need some more hours here
PBmtg300:1308	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1309	S2:	 that's a that is a good point but er 
PBmtg300:1310	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1311	S2:	 again er we are discussing also with the hongkong people
PBmtg300:1312	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1313	S2:	 and er well it also has to do with the airport itself of course if we can get slots or whatever 
PBmtg300:1314	S1:	 hhh and as the money is done on the import side and you arrive at nine o'clock a m you can deliver till one o'clock to the clients
PBmtg300:1315	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1316	S1:	 they can maybe make a fast delivery in munich area so you can er deliver same day to door er this is a service more there and er i think the rate discrepancy is two three dollars a kilo so 
PBmtg300:1317	S2:	 great great 
PBmtg300:1318	S1:	 maybe you should think more about that factor but er well there'll be a gap to fill up hh so you will end up with a lot of fill-up rates
PBmtg300:1319	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg300:1320	S1:	 erm if you will implement these these munich flights er same time you still keep all flights in amsterdam 
PBmtg300:1321	S2:	 yes yes 
PBmtg300:1322	S1:	 okay so you go er away from a single gateway concept
PBmtg300:1323	S2:	 well er you know it's it's a it's it's a a thing again we are looking and analyzing ourselves also
PBmtg300:1324	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1325	S2:	 because we believe i i see a little doubt in your eyes also
PBmtg300:1326	S1:	 hm
PBmtg300:1327	S2:	 that you say well if you have six flights amsterdam and then say another three in munich which is actually well if you look to the map it's it's quite close to each other hhh but especially they er were also talking about a frankfurt operation and this discussion is also still going on anyway hh er we believe that er munich is still the best opportunity why because servicewise we could cover er the east bloc countries 
PBmtg300:1328	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1329	S2:	 in a better in a better way because er well the transit will be way less
PBmtg300:1330	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1331	S2:	 also italy er we could penetrate better because of service because of again the transit is better 
PBmtg300:1332	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1333	S2:	 hh and we consider it maybe y- unlike yourself we w- but we consider then germany as er two part hh because we say okay a northern part which we say this is the frankfurt area this this is our opinion er [S1] 
PBmtg300:1334	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1335	S2:	 and then the southern part which is the munich 
PBmtg300:1336	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1337	S2:	 is also a different area hh er we can cover that part with that particular flights
PBmtg300:1338	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1339	S2:	 because of course that we say we have now a certain allocation from germany into our amsterdam 
PBmtg300:1340	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1341	S2:	 er operation and slightly this will wake a way to this maybe munich but not in total be- because we want to split germany this a- again this is er a thought that the northern part will still feed in the amsterdam because we believe the distance doesn't make that many difference
PBmtg300:1342	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1343	S2:	 because frankfurt amsterdam is probably the same frankfurt munich in that way so we could serve those two that to the left say the the amsterdam part and then the rest what i explained to you er say to the munich part
PBmtg300:1344	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1345	S2:	 but what still it's it's a thing 
PBmtg300:1346	S1:	 hhh erm 
PBmtg300:1347	S2:	 er which it's i believe still tough to do so because well a lot of capacity is xx 
PBmtg300:1348	S1:	 hh 
PBmtg300:1349	S2:	 and er 
PBmtg300:1350	S1:	 it just a question of philosophy i mean er it's not a sceptic in my eyes er it just er the question where where you're heading as as a company p- er politics 
PBmtg300:1351	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1352	S1:	 yeah er other carriers just go back to a single er gateway concept
PBmtg300:1353	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1354	S1:	 or er like [org28] having a a concept in brussels now plus in in milano
PBmtg300:1355	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1356	S1:	 yeah hh with the two gateway you had been traditionally a one gateway
PBmtg300:1357	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1358	S1:	 which has benefits and which has problems
PBmtg300:1359	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1360	S1:	 why i fully agree to your opinion er if you go to munich by the way munich is better than frankfurt cos er if they got the new runway anyway the xxx for down like hell 
PBmtg300:1361	S6:	 @
PBmtg300:1362	S2:	 er this this was 
PBmtg300:1363	S1:	 so that's why munich is is also for the east hangars you cut down for the cargo from from er south europe or italy 
PBmtg300:1364	S2:	 xx 
PBmtg300:1365	S1:	 plus eastern bloc er by at least one day c- er transit time
PBmtg300:1366	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1367	S1:	 yeah this is why munich is not a bad one 
PBmtg300:1368	S2:	 yeah yeah
PBmtg300:1369	S1:	 sure not hh yeah er better than to go to frankfurt i mean frankfurt amsterdam is really tricky okay we can catch up a little bit hh 
PBmtg300:1370	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1371	S1:	 the southern part in in frankfurt but erm erm it's five hours down there to amsterdam 
PBmtg300:1372	S2:	 well again again er look we we need to see ourselves too if it's gonna happen like this because well we believe that we say okay the catchment area we want to succeed 
PBmtg300:1373	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1374	S2:	 that still the northern of germany 
PBmtg300:1375	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1376	S2:	 feeds in our part in amsterdam and then the southern part er we tried to fill in in the munich but well i believe and er well i believe it's everywhere you know if you are a german you want to particully feed in a german city maybe this this is normal i i think 
PBmtg300:1377	S1:	 it changed in the forwarder's li- and forwarder's life has changed hh client side yes i would say they still have this
PBmtg300:1378	S2:	 all 
PBmtg300:1379	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1380	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1381	S1:	 and national carrier like [org29] and all this is also xxxx 
PBmtg300:1382	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1383	S2:	 so- sometimes is two ways you know in example for example if you are an agent in 
PBmtg300:1384	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg300:1385	S2:	 amsterdam [org4] is the biggest in amsterdam but everybody hates [org4] this this it's er er i don't know how come it's a 
PBmtg300:1386	S1:	 in germany you can do what you want it's [org29] 
PBmtg300:1387	S2:	 if you go to switzerland yeah well

PBmtg300:1389	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1390	S2:	 in in that way it's particully it's totally different again
PBmtg300:1391	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1392	S2:	 but er well i don't know but er again [S1] it it's a thing 
PBmtg300:1393	S1:	 it can work out
PBmtg300:1394	S2:	 and er we believe that well especially with the three flights we still can manage to succeed to get this hh preferred high load factors you know now it's not more the point that say the er the eastbound is well yieldwise is it's nothing but say the westbound it's still very strong and this i- this is particular the asian carriers they can still make those flights 
PBmtg300:1395	S1:	 absolutely yeah 
PBmtg300:1396	S2:	 and er well we had a tremendous year say with the imports and to briefly explain you you know what we also did was is that we had a bid system this is this is incredible hh in in china each station like wuhan chengdu whatever all the [org2] stations which we have they could bid in with space control for space
PBmtg300:1397	S1:	 @
PBmtg300:1398	S2:	 we allocated roughly ninety ninety-two tons as firm bookings and everybody er wanted to have more already in that but well okay they could not and then they had a particular free space but this free space they did a bid system so all the station hh they need to call they say okay er i want to have five tons for a rate of whatever hh and then after four hours the decision was made this is particular for each flight huh
PBmtg300:1399	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1400	S2:	 after four hours the the highest bid run out could take along on that flight
PBmtg300:1401	S1:	 @ @ hh hhh yeah
PBmtg300:1402	S2:	 and i tell you a little secret you know the highest rate was five dollars ninety u s dollars 
PBmtg300:1403	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1404	S2:	 it's er the kilo and this this is a shipment of six thousand kilos this is a 
PBmtg300:1405	S6:	 @
PBmtg300:1406	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1407	S2:	 they pay they paid it this is this this is it's it's inbelievable 
PBmtg300:1408	S1:	 hh i mean that that you not er er put another three f- rotations into europe
PBmtg300:1409	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1410	S1:	 from the export we all know now normally your face should be ow how can i fill this where to get the cargo without ruin the market hh 
PBmtg300:1411	S2:	 i know 
PBmtg300:1412	S2:	 i know 
PBmtg300:1413	S1:	 but erm yeah i said we are far away from from these kind of yields as you know 
PBmtg300:1414	S2:	 uhu
PBmtg300:1415	S1:	 so at the end of the day you play you pay your round trip 
PBmtg300:1416	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1417	S1:	 with import cargo 
PBmtg300:1418	S2:	 yeah

PBmtg300:1420	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1421	S1:	 as long as your admin is is covered er 
PBmtg300:1422	S2:	 yeah yeah but the danger the danger 
PBmtg300:1423	S2:	 [S1] the danger is quite nearer look the westbound is now okay but the eastbound er as we all know rates are whhhh @@ and you see this imbalance is getting closer to the the break even more and more because the 
PBmtg300:1424	S1:	 er it will be
PBmtg300:1425	S2:	 especially yeah okay but the there the there's a scenario 
PBmtg300:1426	S1:	 it's 
PBmtg300:1427	S2:	 suppose now hh you know the united states at this moment some routes may be not very profitable i am talking mono routes whatever hhh and you see that a lot of capacity from there is turnover to this asian market 
PBmtg300:1428	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1429	S2:	 try to have this profit because everybody thinks it's still very profitable so this may be ruin say also this may be this westbound traffic from that side suppose there's somebody coming in there and is dumping the rates at that end then this imbalance is very coming to a break even point that a lot of 
PBmtg300:1430	S1:	 yeah but this imbalance will will continue to rise
PBmtg300:1431	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg300:1432	S1:	 definitely i mean erm it was traditionally on one to six one to seven now we are sure al- already at one to ten that's why every carrier especially the far east carrier are starting more and more rotations into europe
PBmtg300:1433	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1434	S1:	 cos more and more production is in the far east area hh erm for the next two three four years i er don't see a change at all
PBmtg300:1435	S2:	 no no
PBmtg300:1436	S1:	 cos nobody will withdraw the flights 
PBmtg300:1437	S2:	 er parti- particully you know also what's is in stake is the culture i believe you know because if you see how they make deals there 
PBmtg300:1438	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1439	S2:	 together the airlines together they say well they talk around they have weekly conference calls together 
PBmtg300:1440	S1:	 mhm

PBmtg300:1482	S7:	 xxx 
PBmtg300:1483	S2:	 to i i start over again er [org2] we're er at the moment in the point of view to er expand ourselves again and er germany is er this year on the road to er open our own online station so pure a [org2] station and er officially we may announce it will be frankfurt or munich but it's munich hh so we're gonna fly to munich and er this is i just explained to [S1] that we er i just had this availability of er of days which we are pre-planning those flights which are on day one and day four and day six hhh but again er internally it's still also a point of discussion you know [first name13] and myself we are trying to convince the hongkong people from er other options of days why because again they choose those days again because of the eastbound you know and the westbound situation 
PBmtg300:1484	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1485	S2:	 they say well our imports are strong on those days so okay we wanna fly on those days but again erm i explained to [S1] from hey look er day one is not a preferable day for us because well this is a week day it's a monday so well it's it's not a very good top day to have this flight to munich hhh and then [S1] explained okay er the fourth which we have er in plan 
PBmtg300:1486	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1487	S2:	 is maybe also not a good scenario to have it and then er maybe the
PBmtg300:1488	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1489	S2:	 the day three would be a good option solution maybe to have it 
PBmtg300:1490	S1:	 hh er postpone just just on day four is a good flight day but postpone from the morning to the evening
PBmtg300:1491	S2:	 an- anyway this this 
PBmtg300:1492	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1493	S1:	 then you have the chance to get the cargo in time
PBmtg300:1494	S2:	 yeah hh er this a- again you know it's er i i just received a message yesterday from hongkong 
PBmtg300:1495	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1496	S2:	 er slightly a schedule but also er what i didn't explain to you also hh we're gonna have flights manchester munich dubai
PBmtg300:1497	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1498	S2:	 hongkong hh we are still er looking to opportunities from maybe amsterdam munich er or 
PBmtg300:1499	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1500	S2:	 whatever 
PBmtg300:1501	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1502	S2:	 er all kinds of structures of routes but more or less those days hongkong prefer to fill in er destiny er the day of operation say out of munich and this this 
PBmtg300:1503	S1:	 what what what are the fees in in hong- and in munich for time being for landing handling 
PBmtg300:1504	S2:	 a- again [S1] 
PBmtg300:1505	S1:	 with with payment the the landing handling fees in munich where are they 
PBmtg300:1506	S2:	 i didn't er kept myself busy with this hh 
PBmtg300:1507	S1:	 you have to look okay mhm 
PBmtg300:1508	S2:	 but i believe you know er this is also a point that why we choose munich also because of this because it was lower
PBmtg300:1509	S1:	 yeah something you can afford 
PBmtg300:1510	S2:	 especially well munich and if you look to munich the airport is tremendous full of course 
PBmtg300:1511	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1512	S2:	 that's also a point and also a third point was that munich [org29] was the only operator at that moment with freighters so er we were quite new 
PBmtg300:1513	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1514	S2:	 as a new cargo airline to come to munich hh 
PBmtg300:1515	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1516	S2:	 munich they welcomed us from if we were kings because well munich want to expand themselves also 
PBmtg300:1517	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1518	S2:	 it's er it's also a good thing hh but well especially it was the purpose and the major thing that we choose this destination is because of the catchment areas and this is the the major point that we can spread more let's say the southern part the east bloc 
PBmtg300:1519	S7:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg300:1520	S2:	 and then we put the north side and the scandi- scandinavian part whatever
PBmtg300:1521	S7:	 okay 
PBmtg300:1522	S2:	 and this is more or less the the idea behind it hh well this this all [S7] this er 
PBmtg300:1523	S1:	 hh 
PBmtg300:1524	S2:	 is gonna start er probably april may what they promise us but [first name13] and myself we believe we were gonna start june july and this all depends on the delivery of our plane which is now er in a conversion way to to build to this cargo er configuration which we need to have to operate this it's not only particular because of this plane because we have now three planes hh and if you look to our block hours at the moment which we fly it's only eighty per cent
PBmtg300:1525	S7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1526	S2:	 but we do this on purpose especially to make sure our service is becoming flexible why because hh if you blockhour your operation hours of your plane too much and something is bvʊm like this technical whatever 
PBmtg300:1527	S1:	 you have a problem
PBmtg300:1528	S2:	 then you have a big problem the whole rotation goes out and now we can fit in very flexible very fast in that way
PBmtg300:1529	S1:	 this is what [org33] always have they have er er official block hours of nine to two
PBmtg300:1530	S2:	 yes
PBmtg300:1531	S1:	 yeah but er reality is er less than seventy cos er a o gs are one after the other
PBmtg300:1532	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1533	S1:	 yeah and that's exactly why eighty eighty per cent is a goo- is is really good value hh block hours
PBmtg300:1534	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1535	S2:	 er we we we kept in on purpose around the eighties
PBmtg300:1536	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1537	S2:	 we did this on purpose especially because to make sure and especially we want to promote and extend themselves to that market as we are a a cargo airline hh but we want to give the service as a passenger airline and that you only can do to fly on time
PBmtg300:1538	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1539	S2:	 and er be your in schedule 
PBmtg300:1540	S7:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1541	S2:	 make it secure
PBmtg300:1542	S7:	 sure 
PBmtg300:1543	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1544	S2:	 and this is why we did the block hours x but if the fourth plane comes in again your flexibility is way higher but then again we're gonna open er i i forgot to mention also well tokyo we're now at this moment er

PBmtg300:1666	S2:	 it's it's er 
PBmtg300:1667	S1:	 would definitely agree we'll not er go for the ad hoc market hh but you know our system we will not come to you if you're not requ- requested for a special rate and surely we will not come for one ton er four to five ten tons it starts er but we have to ask hhh the rates are forty and lower already yeah
PBmtg300:1668	S2:	 it's good 
PBmtg300:1669	S1:	 and erm we all know 
PBmtg300:1670	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1671	S1:	 that [org4] especially and [org30] er are are ruining the market hhh but erm 
PBmtg300:1672	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1673	S1:	 what we really would need cos we just have this one request which came from scandinavia means we will not go with this rate on the market erm scandinavia is still higher hh but we need it for trucking for handling for all these these things yeah erm 
PBmtg300:1674	S2:	 how how much is that did you say [S1] 
PBmtg300:1675	S1:	 two options 
PBmtg300:1676	S1:	 er er this would be
PBmtg300:1677	S2:	 trucking handling 
PBmtg300:1678	S1:	 er yeah a little bit erm depending on on the utilization of trucks we have cos we have we have continue but we need hh need roughly thirty cents
PBmtg300:1679	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1680	S1:	 if you have to bring it to amsterdam cos if we have to bring it from scandinavia first to luxembourg to handle it and bring it then to amsterdam so it's a it's a twice trucking scenario hhh erm in overall i can make life very easy there're two rates i have in mind depending on what you can do either it's the fifty cents ex frankfurt
PBmtg300:1681	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1682	S1:	 ex luxembourg to have both options so you arrange a truck from here you get rounds with five hundred kilograms er or we deliver to amsterdam 
PBmtg300:1683	S2:	 but then 
PBmtg300:1684	S1:	 then we need forty-five minimum
PBmtg300:1685	S2:	 okay 
PBmtg300:1686	S1:	 even then you have not given me the best offer for the same 
PBmtg300:1687	S7:	 hm 
PBmtg300:1688	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1689	S1:	 cos we have forty-two with [org30] pickup from luxembourg warehouse
PBmtg300:1690	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1691	S1:	 and they want to have also the cargo this is 
PBmtg300:1692	S2:	 okay 
PBmtg300:1693	S1:	 purely the market scenario hh i can live with a little bit higher rate if you arrange the pickups we have to agree cos to have an easy scenario for a flat rate plus one hundred kilograms target is to build up units
PBmtg300:1694	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1695	S1:	 this is absolutely clear
PBmtg300:1696	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1697	S1:	 erm we have to talk about the pivots then yeah
PBmtg300:1698	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1699	S1:	 and as soon i i think for the monday flight we can build up definitely already hh for the rest it's it's a new business which we can attack yeah it's a little bit an attack business er w- together with [org1] scandinavia and then we would have for us the benefit would be we have the base load again we would have the base load to s- kick off a system er another story again hhh where we can then feed also other cargo into it
PBmtg300:1700	S2:	 okay
PBmtg300:1701	S1:	 yeah but we need first this base load i mean there is no need to talk about we can bring you two hundred kilograms a week i mean er in general cargo
PBmtg300:1702	S2:	 you know 
PBmtg300:1703	S2:	 you know may- maybe a strange question from my side yeah er it's maybe to bring better to hongkong people that i camouflage it er it maybe sounds strange to you it's it's fooling around with head office actually hh but you say that we have er well pivots it's er well er er what i what i do i i make you a proposal to [S7] and then er hh i then i make a proposal that er well it will be a good offer and then more or less the good offer will be you can find it in in the pivots actually hh so well the pivots i will build in less for example 
PBmtg300:1704	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1705	S2:	 why why i do this if you look er to a certain rate and the hongkong people they always look oh wow er rate is er it's too low but if you camouflage it in a way like in in pivot weight 
PBmtg300:1706	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1707	S2:	 they will not consider it very easily to to have it in like that i can convince them in easier in that way so well i'll make you a proposal that it is is that a good deal which i can do it in that sense
PBmtg300:1708	S7:	 mhm okay 
PBmtg300:1709	S7:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1710	S1:	 yes but you have to bear in mind that the pallets will be maximum one to six if not volume
PBmtg300:1711	S2:	 no
PBmtg300:1712	S2:	 okay well 
PBmtg300:1713	S1:	 so er don't go for a high dense cos for high dense erm erm k- whatever you can offer 
PBmtg300:1714	S2:	 no well if if you x called if if he called me i'd 
PBmtg300:1715	S1:	 if you come with twenty-five cents for high dense er you will not get the car- get the cargo hh yeah cos we handle as well a volume account which runs on a certain carrier hh so we're looking desperately ourselves for for high dense which we can can feed in
PBmtg300:1716	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1717	S1:	 so erm i know that a lot of times on the pivot with three point five tons on a main deck is is tremendously you end up with thirty cents or less hhh but you will never get these
PBmtg300:1718	S2:	 it's it's not 
PBmtg300:1719	S1:	 just want to bring in put realism in we're talking about normal one to six measuring cargo
PBmtg300:1720	S2:	 yeah yeah okay no no problem 
PBmtg300:1721	S1:	 on the on on the pallets
PBmtg300:1722	S2:	 no problem
PBmtg300:1723	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1724	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1725	S1:	 hh okay and if you if you say i mean it's it's erm the way you have to deal within your company erm it's clear hh but erm as we don't know this client and know and don't know exactly this production flow and so on then it will be that we will surely face er a lot of times er cancellations cos if you have two three four hundred kilograms only we cannot build the unit
PBmtg300:1726	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1727	S1:	 yeah okay more or less than for for a friday set-up or something and we'll switch it simply to another carrier instead of also giving this to [org2] and it's cos this was the idea behind the plus one hundred rate
PBmtg300:1728	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1729	S1:	 yeah something just for you whatever you you er want to do
PBmtg300:1730	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:1731	S1:	 and have to do including politics 
PBmtg300:1732	S2:	 well i again [S1] i'm open in that and er i th- i think maybe this is a good solution 
PBmtg300:1733	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:1734	S1:	 absolutely 
PBmtg300:1735	S2:	 or maybe maybe they allow me to do so
PBmtg300:1736	S9:	 hello 
PBmtg300:1737	S2:	 they are 
PBmtg300:1738	S8:	 hi 
PBmtg300:1739	S1:	 yeah i mean i just want to keep everything open on on on the desk so that you can really really look to it
PBmtg300:1740	S2:	 no
PBmtg300:1741	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:1742	S1:	 okay hh 
PBmtg300:1743	S2:	 you have maybe more questions er [S7] 
PBmtg300:1744	S1:	 this one

PBmtg300:2117	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2118	S2:	 and this is the eight three thirties and this is pure to tokyo of course we can offer say within china or for within japan excuse me er several destinations but this all is connections on trucks and this is to to let you know it's all pure based on the [org38] airlines er connection is pure the same trucking scenario they have
PBmtg300:2119	S8:	 oh

PBmtg300:2162	S2:	 lower lower deck pallets 
PBmtg300:2163	S8:	 mhm

PBmtg300:2167	S8:	 okay

PBmtg300:2171	S8:	 [first name19] just send out a schedule that was for xx 
PBmtg300:2172	S2:	 and i give you the configuration of the the tonnage also what we do with japan especially we are controlled by space controllers in hongkong erm we have a fixed allocation on the osaka route and we trying to get a fix allocation on the tokyo routes also but this is an a a point which we need to discuss first 
PBmtg300:2173	S8:	 yeah well 
PBmtg300:2174	S2:	 with the dispatcher say in er in hongkong
PBmtg300:2175	S8:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg300:2176	S2:	 but especially if i look to the netherlands there is a demand say to tokyo which well which is pretty fair for this eight three thirty 
PBmtg300:2177	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2178	S2:	 and then i'm talking maybe as a one lower deck pillar this this is for us to fill for that particular flight is it's okay 
PBmtg300:2179	S8:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg300:2180	S8:	 mm 
PBmtg300:2181	S2:	 on the freighters we have more capacity but er we notice this is becoming too less but again then they compare the yields again with their own yields which they can make out of china and this is well very high at the moment
PBmtg300:2182	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2183	S2:	 and this this is a point of view i need to discuss with hongkong try to get this better hh because what you say now concerning the rates is it's a thing which [org2] will not allow i am sure
PBmtg300:2184	SX-7:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2185	S8:	 but what's er your point in that

PBmtg300:2765	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2766	S2:	 and then er er you get a more view concerning our japan but well actually 
PBmtg300:2767	S8:	 i mean 
PBmtg300:2768	S2:	 about japan it's it's it's it's quite easy within [org2] because er the only destination by freighters then is is osaka
PBmtg300:2769	S8:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:2770	S2:	 and again we can serve osaka with er this this freighter but with then the connections like the well the other destinations er but again by truck the connection 
PBmtg300:2771	S8:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:2772	S8:	 well the problematic is the the high capacities ri- right now in the market so with the alternate that's the problem the ma- major problem you know
PBmtg300:2773	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2774	S8:	 but er as soon as er these get er tight is a good solution as well of course 
PBmtg300:2775	S2:	 uhu 
PBmtg300:2776	S2:	 are you are you maybe open for discussion er er like 
PBmtg300:2777	S1:	 you don't know 
PBmtg300:2778	S2:	 what i explain with er or talk with [S3] also to give me maybe a a hint concerning the rate but this this seventy i believe is 
PBmtg300:2779	S1:	 yah that's this was already and er then we could do something on the market hh but to be honest the rates you you have mentioned erm are available 
PBmtg300:2780	S2:	 this this 
PBmtg300:2781	S1:	 on direct flights [org30] er [org29] and all of these hh so i think er there is no 
PBmtg300:2782	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2783	S1:	 possibility for a steady business
PBmtg300:2784	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2785	S1:	 this would be only the same argumentation we had in before for hongkong if we have to open a b service and we have to go to [org1] with a rate which is better but they have then the local rates of eighty eighty-five cents with er the [org21] airlines with the [org33] 
PBmtg300:2786	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2787	S1:	 locally and you know we need this fifteen twenty cents add-on for our ground network for handling for transfer rate erm so with seventy i would have seen maybe a chance but erm with higher for transhipment it's it will be tricky to to launch it and erm 
PBmtg300:2788	S8:	 yah 
PBmtg300:2789	S1:	 but what i would certainly would er what i wanted to say before is hh erm if you can erm for the flight schedules
PBmtg300:2790	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:2791	S1:	 do you still have real flight schedules cos you never know yah and if you wou- could send us two three four flight schedules so that everybody can have one on the desk what are your destinations when are you leaving when are you going we know the schedule from from amsterdam from the freighters hh but you never know sometimes we have this five kilogram parcel which has to move 
PBmtg300:2792	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:2793	S1:	 and we're looking for an alternative so 
PBmtg300:2794	S2:	 yeah absolutely i will update you 
PBmtg300:2795	S1:	 yeah if you can send something 
PBmtg300:2796	S2:	 update with er well the schedule of course and er 
PBmtg300:2797	S8:	 yeah

PBmtg300:2801	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2802	S1:	 what might be from interest cos we sometimes a request on ad hoc if you use your trucking service hiroshima sapporo

PBmtg300:2809	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2810	S2:	 er with the new plans that tokyo is gonna be open they closed our hiroshima office and moved those people or gave them the opportunity to go to the tokyo office 
PBmtg300:2811	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2812	S2:	 why they're centralizing more the japan er offices into not to have everywhere er [org2] people 
PBmtg300:2813	S8:	 no but i mean er trucking should be kind of expensive no because er tokyo hiroshima is more than thousand kilometers away so er @@
PBmtg300:2814	S2:	 yeah but that's that's particully because the destination is maybe better served er and the demand is maybe higher that's why they choose for this particular destination this 
PBmtg300:2815	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2816	S8:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:2817	S2:	 but again deci- decision made in hongkong

PBmtg300:2821	S8:	 x i know i know

PBmtg300:2823	S8:	 yah it's also
PBmtg300:2824	S1:	 er who is not doing it which size you can do and er if you have this you know nobody if you have it on your desk you have everything already on your desk er and then you look and you will call the airline which we have on your desk no matter if it's ten cents or fifteen cents higher cos you have a solution already yeah that's what i mean if you can give us the goods and prices er would be would be from your benefit at the end of the day maybe 
PBmtg300:2825	S2:	 yeah yeah okay i understand 
PBmtg300:2826	S2:	 yah

PBmtg300:3115	S2:	 er maybe in ten years they are all gone the fokkers you know the spare parts and stuff they they dedicated say in amsterdam some of them they still make but for the rest er 
PBmtg300:3116	S1:	 just wait if it takes ten years er if city hoppers er will then called [org30] city or whatever i mean yeah and then they have er some other aircrafts er very fast
PBmtg300:3117	S2:	 correct 
PBmtg300:3118	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3119	S2:	 er that's that's that's the future i believe you know you see that a lot of airlines they er say they're well forcing together and you see then at the end of the of the whole thing that you get major big airlines that they are under one flag they are trying to operate whatever and this is becoming more and more trendy 
PBmtg300:3120	S1:	 it's the only way to do it 
PBmtg300:3121	S2:	 and it's getting only only huger and huger but this this is on passenger size you know that now you see nowadays that they try to do this is cargo side but this is so complex that 
PBmtg300:3122	S1:	 passenger is ea- er is easy cos you have always 
PBmtg300:3123	S2:	 correct 
PBmtg300:3124	S1:	 two way
PBmtg300:3125	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3126	S1:	 yeah who wants to fly somewhere is coming back but the cargo is is very tricky but 
PBmtg300:3127	S2:	 you know er my my time when i work for [org3] that at that time [org3] thought they had made a very smart deal with [org42] [org42] they should be there let's say the g s a of europe for the cargo side well 
PBmtg300:3128	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3129	S2:	 they didn't work at all because er the administration of it this is i- so complex to feed in to both administrations it is impossible to do so it could be possible but then there would be 
PBmtg300:3130	S1:	 then [org3] [org3] did it now with er [org30] [org3] is vanish 
PBmtg300:3131	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3132	S1:	 completely also you go to cargo side
PBmtg300:3133	S2:	 yeah
PBmtg300:3134	S1:	 so there there they make it
PBmtg300:3135	S2:	 uhu 
PBmtg300:3136	S1:	 and i expect that [org30] and [org4] will do the same even more 
PBmtg300:3137	S2:	 they say they will not but of course everybody thinks it's gonna happen well well 
PBmtg300:3138	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3139	S1:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3140	S1:	 i think the brand name [org30] and the brand name [org4] will vanish and it will be called the the the [org43] airlines or er i don't know what yeah and then 
PBmtg300:3141	S2:	 you know er all the dutch they say well this is again er something national which we believe is locally which we have in in our country
PBmtg300:3142	S1:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3143	S2:	 which is gonna disappear slightly from our country again 
PBmtg300:3144	S1:	 or it will be named [org4] in the netherlands but in the rest of europe it will be [org30] 
PBmtg300:3145	S2:	 yah right 
PBmtg300:3146	S1:	 can also be very easy 
PBmtg300:3147	S2:	 right 
PBmtg300:3148	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3149	S1:	 hh now for me more important is er what er will be the new regulations from f a a and t s a within the next two three years cos er 
PBmtg300:3150	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:3151	S1:	 if i see it correctly at the i see the cargo vanishing from the passenger flights on the long run
PBmtg300:3152	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:3153	S1:	 one more attack one more plane falling down 
PBmtg300:3154	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:3155	S1:	 i think this will be and then er airlines like [org26] like [org2] which are really concentrated on cargo 
PBmtg300:3156	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3157	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3158	S1:	 have a big er benefit against these [org29] and er [org30] as well really concentrated on th- on the passenger side
PBmtg300:3159	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:3160	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3161	S1:	 yah this will be a big boost 
PBmtg300:3162	S2:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3163	S1:	 yah but erm hh 
PBmtg300:3164	S2:	 but you know they experience that they can try it and that this is maybe a a good spoi- point they might have but again if er well i i used to work i start on the airport when i started in the in the cargo with [org44] then [org44] got bankrupt then [org3] took over our company [org44] then 
PBmtg300:3165	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg300:3166	S2:	 that time but always when companies take over each other there's always a fight first of all the positions and then the relationship between the people because you always get two sides 
PBmtg300:3167	S1:	 yah 
PBmtg300:3168	S2:	 one side the former company and on the other side is the new company and thi- this is not ni- it is not nice
PBmtg300:3169	S1:	 it takes long time i mean look to er the same we have in the forwarding industry [org45] [org7] [org46] how long did it take er [org7] and [org46] to come together 
PBmtg300:3170	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg300:3171	S7:	 yeah but they managed better than expected no
PBmtg300:3172	S1:	 what
