POwgd325:38	S1:	 yeah okay thank you 
POwgd325:39	S1:	 erm to start with i just want to add a little bit more to the my presentation yesterday because what i was not very er careful about saying is that er internationalization is a very important issue in in the restructure of the norwegian er degrees and er th- that means that every student should have the right to go abroad for one semester for thirty credits both in his bachelor degree or in his master's degree and er of course to make sure that that works the departments have to go into agreements with other universities to have er to to make sure that the student goes to a place where the courses can be recognized in the program that the student is taking in [place19] or in in norway so that er erm w- well the the ministry is not very pleased with us because too few students want to go abroad and of course as was said of other countries yesterday the norwegian students tend to go to english-speaking countries and it's very difficult to make them go to to to other countries that is if they're not the language they're studying then of course they go to france if they're studying french and so on hh but but er w- the idea never came upon us to to call that a joint de- d- degree 
POwgd325:40	S14:	 yeah 
POwgd325:41	S1:	 you're supposed to be a a semester abroad but but that's just within the ordinary degree and erm er well it's erm it's taking a lot of work for the departments to make agreements with other universities the course ha- has as i said er to be recognized in advance and of course you have to see to it that the student pass the courses a- as well but erm er that's well internationalization as such hh and well to my head that is not a joint degree but some of the things that i've heard today or and yesterday 
POwgd325:42	S3:	 xxx 
POwgd325:43	S2:	 absolutely 
POwgd325:44	S1:	 it gave me an idea that to some of you that might be a joint degree am i right

POwgd325:51	S13:	 sorry 
POwgd325:52	S1:	 [S13] 
POwgd325:53	S13:	 erm i was ju- just wondering er what do you think are the main reasons that too few students or that not er a big amount of students wants to go abroad or to other countries than english-speaking countries
POwgd325:54	S1:	 well er it's so er partly because their knowledge of other languages is not too good 
POwgd325:55	S2:	 speak english 
POwgd325:56	S13:	 so it's it's really a linguistic 
POwgd325:57	S1:	 y- er er yes er for instance in in in norway we have a 
POwgd325:58	S13:	 reason 
POwgd325:59	S1:	 big problem at the moment to keep german up as a a academic discipline because of lack of students because it used to be erm 
POwgd325:60	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd325:61	S1:	 a language that you had to to take at school 
POwgd325:62	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd325:63	S1:	 but it's not so popular any more but no the ministry's done to do introducing a new scheme so that more pupils will have to take it in secondary school but er 
POwgd325:64	S12:	 hm 
POwgd325:65	S1:	 it it's a it's a problem 
POwgd325:66	S13:	 mhm 
POwgd325:67	S1:	 and er of course er er er as er as you may know there is a difference in the northern countries and erm and er in southern european countries because er english is so much more common in daily life and one of the reasons for that is that we never dub the programs on television

POwgd325:335	S1:	 just to give you an idea hh no why you're setting up the program i mean 
POwgd325:336	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd325:337	S1:	 you really have it it has to be a need of the mem- er of the institutions to to do th- er er it's er a sort of necessity i think it should be not just such a thing er er er will we also have it it has to be a necessity i think that's important and then choose your partners carefully on a course of within the [org1] network there're fewer partners than er within the world network or in the the bigger european network develop well-defined program goals and student learning outcomes with your network partners and that's 
POwgd325:338	S14:	 hm

POwgd325:343	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:344	S1:	 ensure that the sufficient academic and administrative staff resources are involved in the program and i think that's

POwgd325:346	SX-f:	
POwgd325:347	S1:	 i mean a program once is it set up it doesn't just go on for itself it has to be helped and sort of followed all the time ensure that an sustainable funding strategy for the program is in place that's of course very important take care that the information about the problem is easily accessible to students that's another question you you just er i mean in too many cases just some people happen to know about it but it's not a general knowledge not something y- you don't find it hh organize and plan sufficient meetings in advance develop language policy and encourage local language tu- learning and decide who is responsible for what and er of course all these er golden rules are important but but you have to sort of have a i think a more concrete plan 
POwgd325:348	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd325:349	S1:	 to to to work from and what i asked er j- just at a conference some months ago could we have just a more definite set of questions that had to be met and answered in an appropriate way to to to make sure that when colleagues in academic fields just well find out oh they meet and say well we could make a joint program how do they go on could they er could we sort of implement in our departments that when i have an idea about that i go to the dean and the dean will know how to to follow this 
POwgd325:350	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd325:351	S1:	 to make it clear and er and er th- that's another erm question of course it has to be realized on all the differ- er the central plan of the university at the faculty and also at the department they all have to be working for this but to be er quite concrete about how to make such a a form or set of questions well i would ask you to well [S14]

POwgd325:362	S1:	 mhm

POwgd325:612	S4:	 different public universities and the program are not the same in the same city so i can ex- expect that 
POwgd325:613	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:614	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:615	S4:	 you're teaching something equal to me but i accept the quality 
POwgd325:616	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:617	S4:	 the way the the education profile

POwgd325:619	S4:	 you are you your university 
POwgd325:620	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:621	S4:	 and so on so er i think that we will be realist in this sense hh we wish to build something all together now we have only for the first question to try to iden- identify some area public choice public economics economy economia applied economics for example

POwgd325:649	S1:	 and i and i and i i do agree with you er fully and and i think that what should be the esp- specialities of the un- [org1] networks er different from the other networks 
POwgd325:650	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd325:651	S1:	 and i think that one of the one of the hm main fields that the [org1] i- institution really could contribute is in different sorts of comparative studies because we have a you have to sort of of arising the the common knowledge of what what is going on in europe and and to make comparative studies within for instant education immigration be- er language problems because you have er fields of immigrations and how to teach languages and so on and and urban studies of course is part of that so if you could y- you could just make er masters comparative masters vari- rising the the knowledge i- in the different institution in in europe about how they proceed in these different fields that would be and and higher education education anything so so that's one one thing and and another thing is of course to find out er in in for instance in science which is a problem all over the place er some institutions have well they have spe- specialized in that direction and others in that direction and we they could could connect they could just find out where at which university can my students 
POwgd325:652	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:653	S1:	 find a speciality that we don't have here but that we need to sort of educate people in so if we could f- sort of find people where hm erm find erm er areas where comparative studies would be a great idea i think we really have something er er something to do
POwgd325:654	S4:	 hh er sorry [S1] er 
POwgd325:655	S1:	 and and yeah 
POwgd325:656	S12:	 could we make a list of speakers otherwise it's xxxxxxxx 
POwgd325:657	S4:	 er what what needs er comparative studies at the end 
POwgd325:658	S1:	 i think it was received as turn at the moment 
POwgd325:659	S15:	 maybe m- maybe we we can 
POwgd325:660	S4:	 sorry 
POwgd325:661	S7:	 w- we should er maybe 
POwgd325:662	S4:	 er 
POwgd325:663	S4:	 a round 
POwgd325:664	S7:	 er er er er er a round 
POwgd325:665	S4:	 round 
POwgd325:666	S7:	 and er each of 
POwgd325:667	S15:	 and then make a summary of su- such er er and then to summarize 
POwgd325:668	S4:	 yes 
POwgd325:669	S7:	 and each of us w- would er 
POwgd325:670	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:671	S15:	 i think you can tackle 
POwgd325:672	S7:	 would speak 
POwgd325:673	S15:	 you can tackle the question first question from at at least two points of view or strategic point of view it means you say okay urban studies er comparative studies migration er be- because you it's important for h for europe huh er of course 
POwgd325:674	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:675	S15:	 if if you say er it also the the research er erm from your own university could be a driving force because you want to work with a team in another university 
POwgd325:676	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:677	S15:	 and that's because you're very good in a subject as well you mean i i what i want to make clear is you you can make a choice like okay what is strategically 
POwgd325:678	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:679	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:680	S15:	 important for europe and for the network
POwgd325:681	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:682	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:683	S15:	 i mean subject-like h you mo- mo- mobility urban issues er comparative studies et cetera because it's important
POwgd325:684	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:685	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:686	S15:	 and we know that we have a a know-how within our institutions but on the oth- that that because the institutions and the network thinks that it's important but if you take one institution the institution can say okay for me let's say er b- er er biochemic -s er is very important i want to find a team in another university 
POwgd325:687	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:688	S15:	 so that will be on research basis or on other contacts not on on the institutional level er 
POwgd325:689	S1:	 hm hm 
POwgd325:690	S15:	 i think this are two er different ap- approaches 
POwgd325:691	S1:	 two different yes 
POwgd325:692	S15:	 because you 
POwgd325:693	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:694	S15:	 you have to th- there is a driving force within your university that wants to cooperate with other teams 
POwgd325:695	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:696	S1:	 exactly 
POwgd325:697	S15:	 and there is also a level a strategic level where you s- where the institution can say okay we support this 
POwgd325:698	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:699	S15:	 yeah individual er initiatives 
POwgd325:700	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:701	S15:	 but on er an institutional level we would like to support urban studies for example 
POwgd325:702	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:703	S15:	 or something because it's important 
POwgd325:704	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd325:705	S1:	 mhm that's right then
POwgd325:706	S12:	 so my point is that i'm afraid that we we we we wouldn't have er manage to to er to give an answer to this question because there're different ways 
POwgd325:707	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:708	S12:	 to arrive at that goal let me say these answer er so one in in my view is top-down 
POwgd325:709	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:710	S12:	 and the other one is bottom-up
POwgd325:711	SX-15:	 is 
POwgd325:712	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:713	SX-15:	 it's the same what x it says 
POwgd325:714	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:715	S12:	 so er 
POwgd325:716	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:717	S12:	 top-down would be that the rectors not us the rectors or a 
POwgd325:718	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:719	S12:	 task force decides 
POwgd325:720	SX-f:	 xx 
POwgd325:721	SS:	 mhm 
POwgd325:722	S12:	 what is relevant 
POwgd325:723	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:724	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:725	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:726	S12:	 for such a network 
POwgd325:727	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:728	S12:	 which are the most important issues contents that should be de- dealt with so this would be 
POwgd325:729	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:730	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:731	S12:	 one perspective the other perspective and i mean this hm i i i wou- i would prefer the second one and this is that we go into the universities and we we evaluate we ask them what are their capacities what is there because you can't er just er erm er what you what you call that er create a new field of study you have to have it 
POwgd325:732	SX-1:	 hm 
POwgd325:733	S12:	 it it has to be there 
POwgd325:734	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:735	S12:	 the people have to be there the infrastructures have to be there so maybe er er this second way is is is is is a good way where we can er after this er make er er a sort of sondage and and and look er what what are the university what what is available in within the universities 
POwgd325:736	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:737	S12:	 and also what is their intention because you can't go into the into the departments and tell people you have to go into a cooperation with somebody else
POwgd325:738	SX-4:	 yah 
POwgd325:739	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:740	S12:	 so erm there have to be has to be a call a sort of a call er how to arrange things within the single universities 
POwgd325:741	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:742	S12:	 and then to bundle to bundle this er er to to to to to er in a sort of clustering 
POwgd325:743	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:744	S12:	 hh er yeah i think this is er this this this could be two ways to proceed er er er to fu- how to further proceed 
POwgd325:745	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:746	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:747	S1:	 but also i think it it would be er an idea to to sort of er map out in in the uni- er within each university to which extent do we have cooperation with other [org1] i- institutions just to see wha- wha- what is it
POwgd325:748	S12:	 of course yah 
POwgd325:749	S12:	 yah
POwgd325:750	S1:	 er 
POwgd325:751	S12:	 also xx 
POwgd325:752	S1:	 do do we which which co- contacts could be sort of er 
POwgd325:753	S12:	 an important issue yah 
POwgd325:754	S12:	 yah 
POwgd325:755	S1:	 made growing
POwgd325:756	S12:	 because er there is the danger that we judge er on on the basis on the knowledge basis that we have as experts in our fields hh for example i am in the humanities i couldn't er i couldn't er er decide what what kind of biogenetical er research er network er has to be developed er some er some some er so this is a danger
POwgd325:757	S1:	 yes and er well 
POwgd325:758	S2:	 well i just wanted to support er [S13]'s point because actually what i wanted to say hh that you know when building this bottom-up approach i think that really this this website is a good er tool good instrument because when i do some kind of research among the faculties among the institutions of our university now and find out that hh ooph a team of people from department of ethnology is interested in some kind of cooperation on a certain topic i can put it up on the web 
POwgd325:759	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:760	S2:	 and try to ask you if you are able to find some other people you would be interested at your university in cooperation with in this particular particular theme or topic
POwgd325:761	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:762	S2:	 so yeah thank you 
POwgd325:763	S1:	 oh no okay 
POwgd325:764	S7:	 i i suppose that we would er 
POwgd325:765	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:766	S7:	 er ask er all of us 
POwgd325:767	S1:	 o- or just or oh okay 
POwgd325:768	S7:	 xx 
POwgd325:769	S1:	 but then the xx 
POwgd325:770	S7:	 yes 
POwgd325:771	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:772	S3:	 i think we we also we have different types of indicators we have the research programs 
POwgd325:773	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd325:774	SS:	 mhm 
POwgd325:775	S3:	 er some of us have dream together hh we also have the mobility because as we hh we we know in which fields we exchange students and which will faculty members are knowing each other and may be 
POwgd325:776	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:777	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:778	S3:	 pleased to built something together then those are 
POwgd325:779	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:780	S3:	 qui- those are questions that you could ask us whi- w- w- where are the collaborations 
POwgd325:781	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:782	S14:	 hm 
POwgd325:783	S3:	 in which type of fields er in research and in in erm 
POwgd325:784	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:785	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:786	S3:	 excha- in the exchange programs erm 
POwgd325:787	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:788	S3:	 that that may help but the bu- but we really have to 
POwgd325:789	S1:	 within the [org1] 
POwgd325:790	S3:	 to go back to what [S15] have said and what you completed we really have to have both er top-down and bottom-up 
POwgd325:791	S15:	 both 
POwgd325:792	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:793	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:794	S3:	 er and and then find find a way to combine things existing things 
POwgd325:795	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:796	S15:	 yah 
POwgd325:797	S3:	 you can't you remember no maybe you weren't we tried many times in this network to have research groups working together and it n- it never worked well because why should i work 
POwgd325:798	SX-15:	 yah 
POwgd325:799	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:800	S3:	 with oslo if i'm already working with trondheim erm and i i know my colleagues dear 
POwgd325:801	S1:	 exactly 
POwgd325:802	SX-15:	 mhm 
POwgd325:803	S3:	 then then er then we should erm we really should pay attention that's the bottom-up part hh we can't force people to work together hh but we can help them if we have incentives from coming from the rectorate 
POwgd325:804	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:805	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:806	S3:	 telling them 
POwgd325:807	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:808	S3:	 we will support you if you build a er a joint degree in this type of field 
POwgd325:809	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:810	S3:	 er 
POwgd325:811	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:812	S3:	 erm which is a nu- [org1] recommended er 
POwgd325:813	S1:	 hm hm hm 
POwgd325:814	S3:	 field
POwgd325:815	S1:	 yes an- a- and of course the the problem at the moment is there are s- m- my rector said to me that there are so many er emails every day 
POwgd325:816	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd325:817	S1:	 from all over the world 
POwgd325:818	SX-f:	 oh 
POwgd325:819	S1:	 someone so you have sort of that the rectors of the univer- [org1] members they have to sort of try to decide where to put their @@ their eyes an- and er to promote that to make the [org1] network something special er different from some of the other networks hh 
POwgd325:820	S3:	 but do we recommend a task force because we should move on from one to do we recommend once again a task force working on point one er hh trying to to take er the the proposals that were er raised mig- migration environment and so on
POwgd325:821	S1:	 yah 
POwgd325:822	S1:	 yes it'd be we should really 
POwgd325:823	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:824	S15:	 let's maybe let's maybe follow the 
POwgd325:825	S3:	 hh yes 
POwgd325:826	S3:	 yes 
POwgd325:827	S15:	 the line er it's 
POwgd325:828	S1:	 yes wha- it's so 
POwgd325:829	S8:	 but er it er but only hh 
POwgd325:830	S15:	 yo- your remarks on the first question
POwgd325:831	S8:	 thi- third er question
POwgd325:832	S11:	 yeah 
POwgd325:833	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:834	S8:	 er yes er i can say that th- thi- thi- this is the same like [S3] said that means we cannot force the people er to er erm to have or to close erm or to contact other partner universities but nevertheless our research team they know each other they an- and a- abroad but of course er your initiative will be welcome 
POwgd325:835	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:836	S8:	 because we can encourage er other people
POwgd325:837	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:838	S15:	 mhm 
POwgd325:839	SX-f:	 yah 
POwgd325:840	S1:	 yes and er yes
POwgd325:841	S9:	 may i just add a more pragmatic about that you know this comes under attractiveness of higher education system within bologna lines
POwgd325:842	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:843	S9:	 and er i completely agree with the bottom-up structure view we have to ask what's important for capitals of of europe and 
POwgd325:844	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:845	S9:	 i will just make a list of the subjects which is really a part of the existing study programs 
POwgd325:846	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:847	S9:	 also at the at the bachelor level and you know i just u- underlined some of them environmental protection which deals with traffic drinking water and and all this kind of thing consumer protection urban studies language teaching social studies comparative studies planning 
POwgd325:848	S1:	 hm hm 
POwgd325:849	S9:	 er and th- there could be plenty of of those but er you know er er i should think that we we could do it really from the bottom-up level you know we cannot invent it by 
POwgd325:850	S1:	 hm hm 
POwgd325:851	S9:	 by heart
POwgd325:852	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:853	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd325:854	S1:	 that's right yes well any any more that want to d- do to this huh
POwgd325:855	S7:	 yes 
POwgd325:856	S7:	 yes i i would like to suggest that er each university er had er erm er within er one month or two months er delay er we would er er er suggest to to the [org3] [org3] 
POwgd325:857	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:858	S7:	 erm fields in which er according to a strategy of bottom-up 
POwgd325:859	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:860	S7:	 there are er erm proposals of each university 
POwgd325:861	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:862	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:863	S7:	 er to to to make this er i i think in my university i have a lot of er of erm topics in which i suppose er it would er er erm have er er people would have interest in building these networks i can er say mi- migrations ethn- ethnical minorities health care molecular biology environment 
POwgd325:864	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:865	S7:	 contemporary history of europe i- in the field of european studies 
POwgd325:866	S1:	 hm

POwgd325:873	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:874	S7:	 maybe i forgot some sub- and er they could be interested i- i- in this er if er i consult them 
POwgd325:875	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:876	S7:	 and they say me not all but five or six we are prepared to get in this program 
POwgd325:877	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:878	S7:	 immediately i could er communicate with you and say put this er proposal in your in the lab 
POwgd325:879	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:880	S7:	 and if i have all proposals in the lab we can er er i can suggest them that they contact 
POwgd325:881	S15:	 you can meet and you can contact and xx

POwgd325:903	S15:	 yeah all right 
POwgd325:904	S10:	 organize ourselves 
POwgd325:905	S2:	 actually it was one of the first task that we had 
POwgd325:906	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:907	S2:	 when we joined the [org3] if i remember correctly
POwgd325:908	S13:	 yes it was er yeah because it we were 
POwgd325:909	S15:	 @@@@
POwgd325:910	S13:	 we asked you to define the main areas of interest basically er 
POwgd325:911	SX-10:	 but it's very difficult i think 
POwgd325:912	SX-f:	 it is 
POwgd325:913	S13:	 but now that we have all met and we know that it is necessary we might 
POwgd325:914	S2:	 it is difficult 
POwgd325:915	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd325:916	SX-f:	 xxx yah 
POwgd325:917	SX-f:	 yah yah 
POwgd325:918	S11:	 i i like to say that er i strongly support this bottom-up er strategy i i think is very difficult and also dangerous to 
POwgd325:919	S1:	 might x 
POwgd325:920	S11:	 to fix er previously from up some fields of study first of all for all the reasons you have said er we cannot force people to make joi- things joint er 
POwgd325:921	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:922	S11:	 if they don't want or also nobody has told but er i want to stress that er this er joint degrees or master whatever are not only for us but for students and of course the students who apply for a master needs to know this master is useful in some sense for his job or whatever so 
POwgd325:923	S1:	 hm hm 
POwgd325:924	S11:	 if we're saying er you wanna stu- study the european studies whatever and er maybe in spain nobody is asking for i i was just saying an example 
POwgd325:925	S1:	 yah 
POwgd325:926	S11:	 maybe is not er an effort very unuseful and very 
POwgd325:927	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:928	S11:	 so i think er un- universities should say shou- should m- make proposals saying the surroundings in in hiera- its area saying what are the necessities what are the utili- usefulness of this or such studies or whatever i'm from pure mathematics 
POwgd325:929	S1:	 hm hm hm 
POwgd325:930	S11:	 so i i want to stress that er we can build a very good europe not only with urban studies and migration er they are very important but i want to stress that if we do 
POwgd325:931	SX-f:	 @@@ hh 
POwgd325:932	S11:	 good pure mathematics and good science and xx er europe will be better @ also not only because of the studies of migration but i am agree that they're very important but we cannot only concentrate in the very very

POwgd325:935	S1:	 hm

POwgd325:1147	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1148	S4:	 who that has this kind of rules for example one year or two year and we are 
POwgd325:1149	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1150	S4:	 measured every single in terms of credits and you know that now we in your in ou- in our life we can accumulate credits so the students that 
POwgd325:1151	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1152	S4:	 decide freely to enter this kind of master knows for example that he can at the end achieve sixty credi- or one hundred what we will decide altogether so

POwgd325:1154	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1155	S4:	 i think tha- i don- i don- really i don't know if it it will be possible to do so but i think if er the community ask to us to push this kind of er initiatives i think that they have er also to be able no to be flexible in regulation and rules the rules and regulation of the master 
POwgd325:1156	SX:	 hm 
POwgd325:1157	SX:	 hm

POwgd325:1194	S4:	 yes 
POwgd325:1195	S1:	 thirty credits
POwgd325:1196	S4:	 xx 
POwgd325:1197	SS:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1198	S1:	 yes so so 
POwgd325:1199	S6:	 thirty or fifteen
POwgd325:1200	SX-15:	 yes 
POwgd325:1201	S1:	 fifteen
POwgd325:1202	S6:	 fifteen 
POwgd325:1203	S4:	 fifteen 
POwgd325:1204	S1:	 a term
POwgd325:1205	S14:	 we have forty 
POwgd325:1206	S4:	 it depends in in in roma 
POwgd325:1207	S11:	 it depends 
POwgd325:1208	S2:	 it depends 
POwgd325:1209	S15:	 that's er i think you can be flexible but it 
POwgd325:1210	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1211	S15:	 it should be workable @ also because that's very important i remember i was present at the urban er studies er 
POwgd325:1212	S11:	 yeah of course of course 
POwgd325:1213	S15:	 er cobra urban studies er er group and they 
POwgd325:1214	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1215	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1216	S15:	 they said okay they have the er you you you remember the er presentation of the rector it's a one year but that one year can fits in er two year in another university but it's a one year huh and they say okay we will move the students 
POwgd325:1217	S3:	 x xx 
POwgd325:1218	S1:	 hm hm hm 
POwgd325:1219	S15:	 because you have different 
POwgd325:1220	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1221	S15:	 p- we will move the students 
POwgd325:1222	S7:	 hm 
POwgd325:1223	S15:	 but they say we want a fixed program 
POwgd325:1224	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1225	S15:	 if you er have to move the students and it is so flexible that they can chose their own program et cetera it's not workable
POwgd325:1226	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1227	S15:	 so what they did what do we need for so they first er erm set the goals of the program they said we need this and this and this and this er for the students and so they went er to look in their own programs what do we have
POwgd325:1228	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1229	S15:	 and then they put together a program 
POwgd325:1230	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1231	S15:	 and er that that's the proposition we'll me- will we move the students because their consideration was hh we can we should be flexible so that one year can fit in a two-year program and et cetera we should be flexible on language issues hh and things like that but not too flexible 
POwgd325:1232	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1233	S15:	 because it it 
POwgd325:1234	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1235	S15:	 should be workable still workable 
POwgd325:1236	S1:	 but but if you have a one-year master's program with a thesis hh and you want to go on could you then 
POwgd325:1237	SX-f:	
POwgd325:1238	S1:	 build on the same thesis and go on with the thesis as well to 
POwgd325:1239	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1240	S1:	 to sort of er make mhm mhm mhm 
POwgd325:1241	S15:	 b- yah yah yah it seems to 
POwgd325:1242	S1:	 to it's just the it's just xxx 
POwgd325:1243	S15:	 that program particularly be- because there is a lot hh of visits to other cities and they take one case er erm et cetera hh er so 
POwgd325:1244	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1245	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1246	S1:	 and er 
POwgd325:1247	S15:	 that program it is workable 
POwgd325:1248	S1:	 yes and i attended a conference in brussels a month ago or 
POwgd325:1249	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1250	S1:	 two months ago hh and and then the question came up well all they say that all er or [first name5] [last name5] said hh that all master's programs should be allowed as entrance exams for erm er er a p h d and er is is that a problem er that er that some masters are not recognized as er the 
POwgd325:1251	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1252	S1:	 the entrance level for a 
POwgd325:1253	S14:	 xxx 
POwgd325:1254	S1:	 a p h d
POwgd325:1255	S14:	 have to be 
POwgd325:1256	S1:	 because because 
POwgd325:1257	S3:	 no it is a re- for us it is a requirement you can't er enter a p h d 
POwgd325:1258	S14:	 our's too 
POwgd325:1259	S3:	 er if you have no master degree 
POwgd325:1260	S1:	 no no that's er that's all ca- a bit well we 
POwgd325:1261	S3:	 and so and all masters 
POwgd325:1262	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1263	S3:	 er lead er all stock and cycle masters lead to p p h d 
POwgd325:1264	S1:	 because we have som- some masters that they say that this master is not well it's too too broad 
POwgd325:1265	SS:	 hm 
POwgd325:1266	S1:	 to to be to to be accepted for a a 
POwgd325:1267	S3:	 no 
POwgd325:1268	S1:	 for a p h d program yes 
POwgd325:1269	S7:	 yes erm er i would like to to follow the suggestion of our colleague of [name2] er in this sense erm i can imagine that any student who er is er studying for a master er i give an example in lisbon 
POwgd325:1270	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1271	S7:	 and erm er he or she er sees in the program of er one of our universities that there is er a very important seminar he would like to to to to have er er related to to er th- er his topic of research 
POwgd325:1272	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1273	S7:	 er er naturally in my view 
POwgd325:1274	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1275	S7:	 it would be good that er informally that is to say not within a joint program but free he could er er inscribe er in this university and find fund f- funds to to have a the possibility of er get in the country and stay for er er a semester or or or something like that
POwgd325:1276	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1277	S7:	 erm er this is mobility er in in the lack of xx and er er this would be very positive how could er the [org1] er contribute to this
POwgd325:1278	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1279	S7:	 er i don't know erm whether er in the frame under the frame of [org1] there is still erm er all er available contract of all universities 
POwgd325:1280	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1281	S7:	 of [org1] er as erasmus partners i don't know
POwgd325:1282	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1283	S7:	 but er the the the best way would be that all [org1] universities were partners in a erasmus contract 
POwgd325:1284	S15:	 we have discussed that before and haven't been accepted with us 
POwgd325:1285	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1286	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1287	S7:	 er er in erasmus contract so that er every student could apply 
POwgd325:1288	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1289	S7:	 to a erasmus grant 
POwgd325:1290	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1291	S7:	 for staying a semester 
POwgd325:1292	SS:	 hm 
POwgd325:1293	S7:	 in a er [org1] er 
POwgd325:1294	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1295	S7:	 in a [org1] university maybe is not very difficult and this could be 
POwgd325:1296	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1297	S7:	 er why er it's difficult i have many students er of er er of my er in my university who are er studying for a semester er or for er er a year er er within th- the erasmus frame
POwgd325:1298	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1299	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1300	S7:	 er why not the [org1] universities 
POwgd325:1301	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1302	S7:	 make a general contract with- within erasmus 
POwgd325:1303	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1304	S7:	 to make more easier to make easier 
POwgd325:1305	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1306	S7:	 for students to get a grant
POwgd325:1307	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1308	S7:	 for this 
POwgd325:1309	S1:	 [S15] you had an answer to that 
POwgd325:1310	S15:	 i don't know i remembered maybe er sh- [S3] i remember we discussed it some years ago
POwgd325:1311	S3:	 we we we tried we tried to do we tried to do this years ago
POwgd325:1312	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1313	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1314	S3:	 what we have er realized that it was not feasible for all [org1] institutions because 
POwgd325:1315	S15:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1316	S3:	 in the in th- in the agreements now you have to defined a field
POwgd325:1317	S14:	 hm 
POwgd325:1318	S3:	 then in some cases we still have one open place for o- o- i have one open place for [org1] partners 
POwgd325:1319	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1320	S3:	 in my er in the in the con- in some of the contracts we signed with partners institution i think that er we we should certainly use the the socrates agreements when we have a master degree in one specific field so that the students who are traveling between the involved institutions get a grant 
POwgd325:1321	S14:	 hm 
POwgd325:1322	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1323	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1324	SX-8:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1325	S14:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd325:1326	S7:	 but this is not any more free 
POwgd325:1327	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1328	S3:	 haeh
POwgd325:1329	S7:	 this is not any more free 
POwgd325:1330	S3:	 what
POwgd325:1331	S7:	 this is already a joint program 
POwgd325:1332	S15:	 no 
POwgd325:1333	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1334	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1335	S7:	 there is not free mobility 
POwgd325:1336	S3:	 no but i think it's something 
POwgd325:1337	S15:	 no 
POwgd325:1338	S7:	 no 
POwgd325:1339	S3:	 it's outside the the this topic in fact 
POwgd325:1340	S15:	 this topic 
POwgd325:1341	S2:	 yes yes 
POwgd325:1342	S7:	 yes well 
POwgd325:1343	S3:	 we we we tried it we didn't we didn't succeed
POwgd325:1344	S7:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1345	S7:	 it's outside topic you're you're right
POwgd325:1346	S3:	 yes er er we we we really have many bilateral agreements between each other hh erm 
POwgd325:1347	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1348	S15:	 yah 
POwgd325:1349	S3:	 but not overall 
POwgd325:1350	S7:	 hm 
POwgd325:1351	S3:	 er agreements 
POwgd325:1352	SX-f:	 hm

POwgd325:1359	S15:	 w- we can't consider it again i don't know we we but maybe a couple of years ago 
POwgd325:1360	S3:	 we we 
POwgd325:1361	S15:	 it seemed that there were vari- various reasons why not to do it yeah 
POwgd325:1362	S3:	 no 
POwgd325:1363	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1364	S3:	 no the reason the main reason i know 
POwgd325:1365	S15:	 it was too con- 
POwgd325:1366	S14:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1367	S15:	 yeah con- linked to constraints 
POwgd325:1368	S3:	 the main reason is that for the it's not hh handable for international offices hh because they re- they get so many applications and then they have to plead hh in the departments 
POwgd325:1369	S15:	 hm 
POwgd325:1370	S14:	 hm 
POwgd325:1371	S3:	 to have them accepting 
POwgd325:1372	S14:	 yah 
POwgd325:1373	S15:	 yah 
POwgd325:1374	S3:	 students from hh institutions who are not their partners hh that's that's the the new way or that's the new socrates who forced us to reduce this type of xx 
POwgd325:1375	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1376	S14:	 yah 
POwgd325:1377	S7:	 er 
POwgd325:1378	S7:	 europe is still too bureaucratic

POwgd325:1423	S1:	 please please please conclude 
POwgd325:1424	S12:	 i think we have to conclude conclude er point two because on the agenda because there're 
POwgd325:1425	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:1426	S12:	 still four four four four different er 
POwgd325:1427	SX-f:	 issues 
POwgd325:1428	S12:	 issues that we have to deal with
POwgd325:1429	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1430	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1431	S12:	 er i i would say that er that er er there is a lot of restructuring on the way actually in all places 
POwgd325:1432	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1433	S12:	 everywhere in europe and so we have to take into account these er situation and therefore there is no way for erm for a rigid structure 
POwgd325:1434	S15:	 hm 
POwgd325:1435	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1436	S12:	 it has to be flexibility and it has to be left to the partners to decide how they 
POwgd325:1437	S14:	 hm 
POwgd325:1438	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1439	S12:	 they manage and how they cope with this difficulties er but 
POwgd325:1440	S1:	 hm hm hm 
POwgd325:1441	S12:	 at the same time i would like to have a sort of recommendation as far as er the duration of the master program is concerned that it has to be two or that it should be two years also taking in- into account the fact that er students should move and they have to to to to to to stay at least for one year in their home country in their home university to get the basis and and all of of this kind of education and and and knowledge that they need to proceed and then they move and so to get get it to tackle all these together er within a program we have to have two years so it makes no sense to have only one year a ye- a one-year master that should be i would like to have it a recommendation er so far
POwgd325:1442	S7:	 yes 
POwgd325:1443	S1:	 hm hh but i er i think mhm 
POwgd325:1444	S15:	 i don't know but we have we are all in different situations in all the countries so 
POwgd325:1445	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:1446	SS:	 yes 
POwgd325:1447	S15:	 we should leave it open 
POwgd325:1448	S12:	 a recommendation not an it's it's not an obligation 
POwgd325:1449	S14:	 yah yah 
POwgd325:1450	S15:	 ah yeah 
POwgd325:1451	S2:	 er er i i i don't 
POwgd325:1452	S1:	 [S14]- [S14] yes [S14] 
POwgd325:1453	S14:	 okay i i agree on that that part of the the erm suggestion hh erm a recommendation on the duration i think that would be just just a sort of a good thing 
POwgd325:1454	S1:	 yah 
POwgd325:1455	SX-1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1456	S14:	 and then the flexibility part hh but a- already on the mobility part erm that could be also a recommendation but i can say already that our rules and recommendations for the for the faculties are different
POwgd325:1457	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1458	S14:	 we are not requiring a compulsory part

POwgd325:1471	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1472	S14:	 an obligatory part of mobility we are saying if you have it fine if you don't have it fine again hh because there are different types of mobility you can have

POwgd325:1475	S14:	 one semester abroad

POwgd325:1484	S14:	 hh so those are the kinds of things that we think because if we if we demand this that every student who participates in this type of program hh it is a burden 
POwgd325:1485	SX-2:	 hm 
POwgd325:1486	S14:	 and i know already that a lot of institutions are saying we're no- we don't want to have this because then we are sort of you know we are chained by this er thing and it is expensive

POwgd325:1508	S1:	 y- would you like to sum up [S13] xxxx 
POwgd325:1509	S13:	 yeah if you all agree then er we would say er that er there is no way of hh kind of hh trying to implement er a rigid structure as concerned the er duration but the partners have to decide individually and hh we have to p- er preserve a certain amount of flexibility hh erm i'm not sure i mean i don't see complete agreement as regards the recommendation of the 
POwgd325:1510	SX-3:	 two years 
POwgd325:1511	SX-m:	 two years 
POwgd325:1512	S13:	 er two years now so i just want to make sure that er we can 
POwgd325:1513	SS:	 hm 
POwgd325:1514	S13:	 take this in as a group 
POwgd325:1515	S7:	 i i i i i suppose it would important to define this two years of duration 
POwgd325:1516	S13:	 yeah okay 
POwgd325:1517	S7:	 hh but i i i suppose it it i- it is important also erm er er erm do not state er erm er regels erm er er reglements 
POwgd325:1518	S1:	 regulations 
POwgd325:1519	SS:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1520	S7:	 that is to say i i can admit that in any cases the student can go abroad er er why not er in first semester this depends on the organization of the joint program 
POwgd325:1521	S8:	 even the topic of the master depends 
POwgd325:1522	S7:	 erm because 
POwgd325:1523	S7:	 erm er for instance er for instance in first semester in the joint program the basic er er 
POwgd325:1524	S8:	 hm 
POwgd325:1525	S7:	 aspects of the the master hh are given in this country 
POwgd325:1526	S12:	 yah yah of course 
POwgd325:1527	S7:	 in this university 
POwgd325:1528	S12:	 of course 
POwgd325:1529	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1530	S7:	 why not er 
POwgd325:1531	S12:	 question of organization yah 
POwgd325:1532	S7:	 er er so er a question of organization 
POwgd325:1533	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1534	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd325:1535	SX-f:	
POwgd325:1536	S12:	 so we take then the two years then 
POwgd325:1537	S1:	 and er 
POwgd325:1538	S1:	 and er and my question whether there's should be joint er developed er courses you didn't answer that but er hh but i suppose that something that also has to be left to the the designers of the program 
POwgd325:1539	S13:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd325:1540	S1:	 hhh then er we go on to to three is there agreement as regards institutional development strategies a- and criteria for quality assurance and control among the [org1] member institutions well i i think that's a tricky one but er @@@ hh 
POwgd325:1541	SS:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1542	SS:	 yes 
POwgd325:1543	S1:	 but erm er because in the field of quality assurance i i i have a sort of feeling that er there are so many almost as many ways of doing it as there are countries
POwgd325:1544	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1545	S1:	 and er er erm as far as i know wh- there's er there've been a lot of conferences on quality assurance but but not on saying well this is the way it is hh but er who would want like to comment on that
POwgd325:1546	S2:	 i er i was i didn't understand well the the question
POwgd325:1547	S1:	 erm the 
POwgd325:1548	S3:	 it's point point three 
POwgd325:1549	S6:	 point three 
POwgd325:1550	S14:	 point three 
POwgd325:1551	S2:	 ah point three ah well

POwgd325:1553	S14:	 [S1] 
POwgd325:1554	S1:	 er yes [S14] 
POwgd325:1555	S14:	 just to say that we are i think we are all developing quality assurance systems within our nations and within our institutions hh and the thing is that at least not in our institution not in our country we are not considering 
POwgd325:1556	SS:	 yes mhm mhm 
POwgd325:1557	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1558	S14:	 really particularly the quality assurance of joint programs
POwgd325:1559	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1560	S14:	 we're considering how to do on our own programs 
POwgd325:1561	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1562	S14:	 within our own country but not for joint programs and that 
POwgd325:1563	SX-f:	 hm

POwgd325:1565	SX:	 hh 
POwgd325:1566	SX-f:	 yah 
POwgd325:1567	S1:	 hh and er and of course part of the answer is the answer that [S4] gave us early this morning hh er saying that well when we go into collaboration with all the university we have to accept that they are well we we accept that they are on the level and they are doing it their way

POwgd325:1569	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1570	S4:	 hm

POwgd325:1572	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd325:1573	S1:	 we do believe that they are as good as they should be @ hh yes 
POwgd325:1574	S9:	 i just said that must be mutual trust between the institutions 
POwgd325:1575	S3:	 yes 
POwgd325:1576	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:1577	S4:	 y- yes 
POwgd325:1578	S9:	 but this can be achieved only if you know for this study programs you have appropriate people 
POwgd325:1579	S1:	 hm hm hm 
POwgd325:1580	S9:	 you know and you can now easily check the quality of the people through the databases like web of science

POwgd325:1582	S1:	 yes 
POwgd325:1583	S9:	 and so on so 
POwgd325:1584	S1:	 and er 
POwgd325:1585	S9:	 whenever we'll propose any such things we we have to have capacities y- you mentioned hh the people th- you know which are qualified to do that 
POwgd325:1586	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1587	S9:	 and then er infrastructure and you know er somebody could er could check but this is usually checked 
POwgd325:1588	SX-f:	
POwgd325:1589	S9:	 within the country you are in you know we have now this er set by the law so also joint program must be checked by our agency for quality 
POwgd325:1590	S1:	 mhm hh and also of course if you have researchers that want to work together you are quite sure that they hh they know what they're doing hh yes

POwgd325:1613	S3:	 i just rem- then that this is here i think we can fit with the hh [first name1] proposal and raise on basic principles that's what we said just before at the general hh meeting because hh it's the one thing is er quality assurances and control but the first part of the cu- question i- institution development strategies hh and in this hh we may er we we may work have someone working on those er the [name4] proposal and [org2] proposal to help hh if we have er for the institutional no institutional tr- strategy hh to to have institution to to to get those er

POwgd325:1620	S4:	 may i give a suggestion on this point er i think two years ago or one years ago our er er institution have presented a xx a document that the european commission where we have to explain what is our hh development strategies at european level 
POwgd325:1621	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1622	S4:	 so we can collect this document we prepare for european commission and to compare

POwgd325:1637	S4:	 and what are the er the master will tend to to to do or what did have already done and so on maybe i think a useful from from this point
POwgd325:1638	S1:	 and and and what we could ask is that whenever you put up a joint degree program 
POwgd325:1639	S4:	 hm 
POwgd325:1640	S1:	 you have to describe in a clear way that the lea- th- the expected learning outcome

POwgd325:1644	S1:	 that's clear to to everyone which level are these students supposed to reach

POwgd325:1667	S15:	 yeah 
POwgd325:1668	S1:	 er there the level where the students enter were s- so different that it

POwgd325:1691	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd325:1692	S4:	 i i think that today we have to agree a general framework of our er engagement because er all the the items you have now said are very important when we really we start in building the integrate curricula and all the rules to enter and er the quality assurance er and other rules that we intend to put in our er master there are w- er er er very 
POwgd325:1693	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1694	S4:	 wide documentation on these and the result of other group studying this problem that we can refer obviously but i think that today we have to agree a general er framework for our work and then slowly slowly

POwgd325:1696	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1697	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1698	S4:	 to cover no the single items i erm i sh- i suppose that all of us intend to do something of serious er first of all for our students and so we will er er put in er in the xx of the master all er the constraints er or the rules that we er intend all together to apply 
POwgd325:1699	S1:	 hm 
POwgd325:1700	S4:	 so i think that er er it it is quite impossible today to think that the single items the single tool and so on if we agree a general framework i think that will be
