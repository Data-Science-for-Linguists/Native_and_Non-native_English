POwsd256:2	SX:	 mhm

POwsd256:4	SX:	 mhm 
POwsd256:5	S1:	 erm i give you a few seconds to think about it and then this somebody already came up with er a few ideas
POwsd256:6	S2:	 i have er for me if i @ @ start 
POwsd256:7	S1:	 yes 
POwsd256:8	S2:	 erm the er really important thought that was mentioned er was that erm young people are taught at schools and perhaps in organizations a lot of important knowledge er but then er nobody t- teach how to how to work how to get employed er so perhaps this this would be er the direction of putting this area er because now the n g os do it help to young people to employ @ er er so er perhaps this direction could be er searched how to er bring this topic to schools to to formal education system 
POwsd256:9	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:10	S2:	 that's it 
POwsd256:11	SX-m:	 yes 
POwsd256:12	SX-m:	 er 
POwsd256:13	S2:	 to to teach children to children and youth to er be workers and to become workers and employers employers employees okay so the wrong words 
POwsd256:14	SS:	 @@@
POwsd256:15	S2:	 employees @
POwsd256:16	S1:	 can i translate this as how can the education system contribute to employment opportunities for young people or 
POwsd256:17	S2:	 yeah but but er very wide widely understood educational system formal and informal but 
POwsd256:18	S1:	 okay 
POwsd256:19	S2:	 also with stress on formal and non-formal @ let's say 
POwsd256:20	S1:	 er er somebody else yeah 
POwsd256:21	S3:	 yeah for me it's as well the the question was how as an organization erm are we able to make possible er the meeting between the polical people and er the young people from the grass roots 
POwsd256:22	S1:	 mhm so how to bring everybody from the grass-roots level and policy makers together 
POwsd256:23	S3:	 yeah 
POwsd256:24	S1:	 can you read it 
POwsd256:25	SS:	 xxxxxxxxxx 
POwsd256:26	S1:	 sorry for that 
POwsd256:27	S2:	 perhaps ca- capital letters 
POwsd256:28	S1:	 i blame it on the xx erm 
POwsd256:29	S3:	 yeah if maybe if you can write in capital letters after that after what from the next question it may help 
POwsd256:30	S1:	 like that okay 
POwsd256:31	S3:	 yeah 
POwsd256:32	S1:	 yeah any other yeah 
POwsd256:33	S4:	 erm for me an interesting question was who's responsible er on the national level for the youth pact because erm i think [first name2] mentioned that in sweden it's the prime minister
POwsd256:34	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:35	S4:	 and i think in austria it's only a ministry 
POwsd256:36	S1:	 yeah and there's just the 
POwsd256:37	S4:	 hm 
POwsd256:38	S1:	 question like you wan- you would like to know who is responsible or who should be responsible 
POwsd256:39	S4:	 hm 
POwsd256:40	SX:	 mhm 
POwsd256:41	S2:	 yeah you you cannot say that 
POwsd256:42	S4:	 yeah 
POwsd256:43	SS:	 xxxxxx 
POwsd256:44	S4:	 yeah and another point was 
POwsd256:45	S2:	 but 
POwsd256:46	S2:	 but but 
POwsd256:47	S4:	 yeah
POwsd256:48	S2:	 you cannot decide it 
POwsd256:49	S4:	 no no yeah but 
POwsd256:50	S5:	 you can make another mention still presumably 
POwsd256:51	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwsd256:52	SX-f:	 mhm yeah 
POwsd256:53	S5:	 if we're writing a paper we can say what we would like to see @ xxxxx whatever 
POwsd256:54	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:55	S5:	 well that's what x policy paper is about 
POwsd256:56	S1:	 erm [S6] 
POwsd256:57	S6:	 erm coming back on the first and the it's not just erm teaching young people and and how to be employees but how to be xxx how to set up their own businesses erm and how to get ahead because what we've seen in england is the decrease of small businesses 
POwsd256:58	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:59	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:60	S6:	 erm and also that leads to the decrease of customer choice where it's therefore falls right into the hands of capitalism erm and it kind of all works hand in hand if we're gonna fight the wide picture we need to make sure that our young people erm to go forward and create their own erm businesses with their own sets of standards where we can implement 
POwsd256:61	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:62	S6:	 erm more workers rights 
POwsd256:63	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd256:64	S1:	 so how to encourage young people to set up their own business or is it not
POwsd256:65	S6:	 y- t- t- yes 
POwsd256:66	SX:	 yes 
POwsd256:67	S6:	 or not to encourage but to give them a tool so that they can if they want to 
POwsd256:68	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:69	S6:	 erm 
POwsd256:70	S4:	 maybe empower 
POwsd256:71	S6:	 hm 
POwsd256:72	S4:	 empower 
POwsd256:73	S6:	 empower 
POwsd256:74	S1:	 empower
POwsd256:75	S6:	 you know about that 
POwsd256:76	S7:	 yes also 
POwsd256:77	S1:	 yes
POwsd256:78	S7:	 x x x x that erm like the controversity between erm implementation at municipal level so that the youth pact will be er you know er more er liberated in depth that was e- er what i noticed that the youth pact has to be implemented at municipal level but also the problem that is erm h- has been noticed by the national government that there is a lack of erm coordination as well as between er different sectors as between er the responsible ministries i guess 
POwsd256:79	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:80	S7:	 and i guess erm the controversity between er er implementing at a municipal level even 
POwsd256:81	S1:	 hm 
POwsd256:82	S7:	 erm e- er er create more fragmentation 
POwsd256:83	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:84	S7:	 in an in the policy of youth policy actually i think that maybe youth organizations er will have a a leading role maybe to er er coordinate erm 
POwsd256:85	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:86	S7:	 such policies at municipal levels or
POwsd256:87	S1:	 okay so maybe th- the question then would be how to how to coordinate the follow-up of the youth pact across the different 
POwsd256:88	S7:	 yeah but 
POwsd256:89	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd256:90	S1:	 er levels geographically then 
POwsd256:91	S7:	 in order that to be coordinated 
POwsd256:92	S1:	 and 
POwsd256:93	S1:	 across the different actors who are involved okay then we can anything else
POwsd256:94	S8:	 i just have a a thought on on the first point erm i mean it's just a thought i i see a little bit danger if if you erm 
POwsd256:95	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:96	S8:	 go and tell such a thing er to certain er policy makers they will immediately erm use it er to go even more in the direction employability and only produce erm or educate people for for the the labor market and i think that's 
POwsd256:97	SX-2:	 hm 
POwsd256:98	S8:	 hh something we don't want i think 
POwsd256:99	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd256:100	S8:	 in the end 
POwsd256:101	SX-2:	 hm 
POwsd256:102	S8:	 there should also be education for education's sake and not only education for 
POwsd256:103	SX-2:	 mhm 
POwsd256:104	S8:	 employability erm i know that you don't mean it 
POwsd256:105	SX-2:	 hm 
POwsd256:106	S8:	 but i i think if a if if certain politicians er see such a suggestion from from young people 
POwsd256:107	S2:	 hm 
POwsd256:108	S2:	 yeah but you know it's er the 
POwsd256:109	S2:	 x 
POwsd256:110	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd256:111	S8:	 they will immediately erm and i think there should be a certain er time in in er education where we er get only education for education's sake and 
POwsd256:112	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd256:113	SX:	 mhm 
POwsd256:114	S2:	 yeah but we x mhm 
POwsd256:115	S8:	 not not al- always a- a- already with the view on erm how can we put you on the labor market 
POwsd256:116	S2:	 yeah but you know the- these are particular 
POwsd256:117	S8:	 hm 
POwsd256:118	S2:	 er particular solus- solutions and of course it could be xxx 
POwsd256:119	S8:	 yeah 
POwsd256:120	S2:	 because there are er at the graphic @ so 
POwsd256:121	SS:	 @@@
