PBmtg463:88	S4:	 alles klar 
PBmtg463:89	S3:	 okay yeah and on the se- on the third page actually you see like always the er all the dispensers you had so far 
PBmtg463:90	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:91	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:92	S3:	 so er you will definitely i think erm order [thing4] [thing5] because you didn't have that much quantity so far everything else is okay so [thing6] next year we will have [thing6] with thr- three new characters 
PBmtg463:93	S2:	 oh great 
PBmtg463:94	S1:	 well this is good 
PBmtg463:95	S3:	 so it will be a family out of six erm yeah but to the assortment plan for next year we can discuss after showing the news 
PBmtg463:96	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:97	S4:	 mhm
PBmtg463:98	S3:	 okay then i give you that's in-market that's i have so that's all your figures you sent me er 
PBmtg463:99	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:100	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:101	S3:	 or that [first name2] sent me on a monthly base also included er the figures of the kosovo 
PBmtg463:102	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:103	S3:	 you see then the next pages you see it then er month by month and er when you have a look on june june the in-market sales are quite big because er it's including six months of the kosovo just in june because he sent me a whole list and i did not divide it into six months and in september er it's included kosovo figures of er of the third quarter so 
PBmtg463:104	S1:	 yes yes yes 
PBmtg463:105	S4:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:106	S1:	 no okay 
PBmtg463:107	S1:	 yes
PBmtg463:108	S3:	 it's one reason why it's it's very big in-market sales in those two months actually and in total your er because saying okay nine months are sold within the markets we should should have er three quarter of total amount actually we have er sixty-four per cent of the dispensers which is little bit below 
PBmtg463:109	S4:	 on the first page 
PBmtg463:110	S3:	 below the plan 
PBmtg463:111	S1:	 below the yeah 
PBmtg463:112	S4:	 on the first page 
PBmtg463:113	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:114	S3:	 er with candies it's okay 
PBmtg463:115	S4:	 compared to to to the plan 
PBmtg463:116	S3:	 compared to the to the total plan
PBmtg463:117	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:118	S3:	 candies is more or less on plan [thing2] erm here the the plan was actually too high with the [thing2] 
PBmtg463:119	S1:	 we were counting on [org3] to do more 
PBmtg463:120	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:121	S1:	 but actually 
PBmtg463:122	S3:	 [org3] sells the [thing2] 
PBmtg463:123	S1:	 they d- they used to but they stopped
PBmtg463:124	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:125	S1:	 so er this was this is the reason maybe why the [thing2] are not that er 
PBmtg463:126	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:127	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:128	S4:	 accepted mhm 
PBmtg463:129	S1:	 yeah

PBmtg463:132	S3:	 find a solution to i don't know 
PBmtg463:133	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:134	S3:	 putting in the in the tins and what else do we have yeah the the [thing9] line the bracelets actually this we did not have in the plan for last year 
PBmtg463:135	S1:	 hm 
PBmtg463:136	S3:	 because we yeah we didn't know how successful they will be probably so it's quite good er [thing10] it's i think [thing10] is going down because there is lots of of low products 
PBmtg463:137	S2:	 competition yeah 
PBmtg463:138	S1:	 yeah there is the erm how do you s- m- ma- [thing11] or something like that locally it's the it's the same thing

PBmtg463:296	S3:	 but to to paint it to color it it's very nice 
PBmtg463:297	S2:	 or or to have something that they can put on but er in a cheap version of paper of 
PBmtg463:298	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:299	S2:	 carton or something that they can play with
PBmtg463:300	S4:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:301	S2:	 this can be also interesting because they can cut it 
PBmtg463:302	S4:	 instead of the plastic you mean 
PBmtg463:303	S2:	 instead of plastic so they can maybe cut it from the backside and then put it on dispenser

PBmtg463:306	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg463:356	S4:	 no no problem

PBmtg463:358	S3:	 yeah that's good sogar and i pass it on immediately to make sure it's on stock all the time because the problem is that er 
PBmtg463:359	S4:	 they are available 
PBmtg463:360	S2:	 hoping they wouldn't some now lack of the 
PBmtg463:361	S3:	 often er in [place1] they they i don't know they produce something else instead or they use the the different foil but even you you got i think the bracelets with the the [place2] foil as well so 
PBmtg463:362	S1:	 we don't mind 
PBmtg463:363	S3:	 we did not care about this yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:364	S1:	 we don't mind 
PBmtg463:365	S1:	 just have them 
PBmtg463:366	S3:	 mhm but this should change 
PBmtg463:367	S4:	 may- may- maybe you can address this once once more this evening to [S5] er to convince him that's that's really something for you you know because hh er in our range internationally the bracelets is 
PBmtg463:368	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:369	S3:	 in serbia and in switzerland
PBmtg463:370	S4:	 is nothing you know and that's why i mean 
PBmtg463:371	S3:	 and in both countries quite good so 
PBmtg463:372	S4:	 yeah right 
PBmtg463:373	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:374	S3:	 because it's listed really listed in in [org8] in switzerland hh and you sell one hundred oder sold one hundred and fifty fift- 
PBmtg463:375	S4:	 and so nobody really takes care of it even if we address it that it is very important 
PBmtg463:376	S3:	 one hundred fifty thousand pieces 
PBmtg463:377	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:378	S2:	 and in croatia and other poor countries 
PBmtg463:379	S4:	 because it's nothing 
PBmtg463:380	S1:	 i'll i'll re- 
PBmtg463:381	S3:	 the problem here is er that croatian er declaration is not on the on the packaging so it's just er 
PBmtg463:382	S1:	 er i'll mention it i'll emphasize it to him tonight to him i'll mention it 
PBmtg463:383	S4:	 jus- just one 
PBmtg463:384	S4:	 once again yeah right 
PBmtg463:385	S1:	 no problem i'll do remind him about it 
PBmtg463:386	S4:	 yeah right 
PBmtg463:387	S3:	 yeah english french er so this main languages and serbia we put in the serbian language hh and this was one of the main problems oder one of the main mistakes actually we did because now on the foil erm i do not have any any croatian or bosnian language on it and even if they would like to have the product it's not possible to bring it in because er i cannot sticker this small packaging because it would be too expensive this product comes from [place1] if you have to open it s- put a sticker on it forget it 
PBmtg463:388	S2:	 and and they are not ready to do it by themselves
PBmtg463:389	S3:	 they are not that erm 
PBmtg463:390	S2:	 organized 
PBmtg463:391	S3:	 organized and dedicated to [org1] like you are actually so it's you know it's 
PBmtg463:392	S4:	 @@@@@@@@@@ that well organized @@@@@@@@@
PBmtg463:393	S2:	 @@@
PBmtg463:394	S3:	 that well organized yeah 
PBmtg463:395	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:396	S3:	 because they have not not the people 
PBmtg463:397	S4:	 no co-packing 
PBmtg463:398	S3:	 to do it 
PBmtg463:399	S4:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:400	S1:	 we have the erm mani- manipulating facility in the warehouse 
PBmtg463:401	S4:	 that's good 
PBmtg463:402	S3:	 but it's good because for all these these kind of different packaging it's it's really you'll be very flexible 
PBmtg463:403	S1:	 and help it helps 
PBmtg463:404	S4:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:405	S1:	 and it helps and also sometimes where you have the producers that they say okay you will have a delay because you cannot you cannot we didn't have time to sticker we do it we do it ourselves very helpful thing to do so 
PBmtg463:406	S4:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:407	S1:	 it's okay hhh 
PBmtg463:408	S3:	 and this is er 
PBmtg463:409	S4:	 yeah gives you much more flexibility 
PBmtg463:410	S1:	 yes thanks 
PBmtg463:411	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:412	S4:	 hm
PBmtg463:413	S3:	 the report [first name2] sent me of [thing2] er the first column and i just er calculated it er in single pieces in the second 
PBmtg463:414	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:415	S3:	 column to see so it's er in july we had the first delivery to [org9] therefore we had around fifteen thousand dispensers yeah and august september was actually quite weak in the sales and hopefully with october with the er t v commercials 
PBmtg463:416	S1:	 hh we ho- we're we're hopefully with t v campaign yes but the good thing is that we hope you see we we have sold so far more or less er we we have sold the the half 
PBmtg463:417	S2:	 seventy per cent 
PBmtg463:418	S1:	 the half of of of of the first 
PBmtg463:419	S3:	 mhm of the this first first order 
PBmtg463:420	S1:	 yeah and we hope to to er to get it all cleared out by the end of the year 
PBmtg463:421	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:422	S1:	 hopefully with the help of t v campaign hh and then the delivery coming in december will give us a stock 
PBmtg463:423	S3:	 so this delivery is fixed you're you'll take this quantity 
PBmtg463:424	S1:	 yeah yeah we will take the delivery in december no problem 
PBmtg463:425	S3:	 okay mhm 
PBmtg463:426	S1:	 we will take the delivery in december and hopefully this will give us now the th- then the january february this is a very weak season for us 
PBmtg463:427	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:428	S1:	 so these are the quantities that will last but the t v campaign is something that will show us 
PBmtg463:429	S2:	 the possibilities 
PBmtg463:430	S1:	 the possibilities of the product 
PBmtg463:431	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:432	S1:	 then w- we we think that the t v campaign is done correctly is is well targeted to the group to the target group it should be and that the s- given that the t v commercial is really great 
PBmtg463:433	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:434	S1:	 and given that we have the distribution on the level that basically people can can buy it now all in er where- wherever they 
PBmtg463:435	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:436	S1:	 they they go we we think that it it will give us erm 
PBmtg463:437	SX-4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:438	S1:	 the er the real it will show us the potential of the product at the market 
PBmtg463:439	S4:	 yeah

PBmtg463:462	S3:	 no you gave me once you you wrote er around like [S4] mentioned er around 
PBmtg463:463	S4:	 i think i think maybe 
PBmtg463:464	S3:	 three hundred thou- three hundred fifty thousand pieces yeah 
PBmtg463:465	S4:	 no i jus- took i right i i mhm 
PBmtg463:466	S1:	 no this was the plan for this year th- we were 
PBmtg463:467	S3:	 no 
PBmtg463:468	S1:	 no for the next year 
PBmtg463:469	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:470	S4:	 but that's quite high isn't it 
PBmtg463:471	S3:	 but it w- it was er quite in the beginning and 
PBmtg463:472	SX-1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:473	S4:	 i think it's yeah 
PBmtg463:474	S1:	 we will see we have to see after the commercial 
PBmtg463:475	S3:	 but that is 
PBmtg463:476	S1:	 after the t v campaign what the results will be 
PBmtg463:477	S3:	 this was from may the the pink one 
PBmtg463:478	S4:	 no becau- yeah yeah because er
PBmtg463:479	S3:	 but this was in may when er maybe it was was was th- 
PBmtg463:480	S2:	 nobody knew anything 
PBmtg463:481	S1:	 yes well i think the thing thing no we said that our estimation varies from one one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty thousand pieces hh this was 
PBmtg463:482	S3:	 the first month 
PBmtg463:483	S4:	 no just 
PBmtg463:484	S1:	 the beginning and for and 
PBmtg463:485	S3:	 for this year 
PBmtg463:486	S2:	 x xxxxx 
PBmtg463:487	S4:	 and this was in regards to fi- to our sales of [thing15] mhm 
PBmtg463:488	S3:	 which is in pink 
PBmtg463:489	S3:	 yes 
PBmtg463:490	S1:	 we compare it with with the sales of [thing15] and we will sell this year around 
PBmtg463:491	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:492	S1:	 two hundred thousand or or something over two hundred thousand 
PBmtg463:493	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:494	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:495	S1:	 pieces 
PBmtg463:496	S4:	 pieces mhm 
PBmtg463:497	S1:	 of [thing15] so this was our erm th- then this was for two thousand seven so we hoped we hoped to to have the sales of the same the sales in two thousand seven the sales of [thing15] 
PBmtg463:498	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:499	S1:	 in two thousand six 
PBmtg463:500	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:501	S1:	 so we hope we hope we still hope we can do it we don't know i- whether it's possible but 
PBmtg463:502	S4:	 no no i jus- yeah i just wanted to to er 
PBmtg463:503	S3:	 yeah because you're 
PBmtg463:504	S4:	 note it down because in our plan that's what i've seen from from your figures is 
PBmtg463:505	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:506	S4:	 that we have we have three hundred fifty thousand pieces in our internal plan which is already er presented to the board just to bring it down on a on a realistic basis i think two hundred and fifty is more realistic than three hundred fifty 
PBmtg463:507	S1:	 it's much more realistic than three hundred and fifty yes 
PBmtg463:508	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:509	S4:	 kannst du das irgendwo trotzdem festhalten 
PBmtg463:510	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:511	S4:	 mhm i mean it doesn't make sense if we communicate from the very beginning such an high er 
PBmtg463:512	S1:	 well the the 
PBmtg463:513	S2:	 expectations 
PBmtg463:514	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg463:515	S4:	 expectations and we cannot fulfil it and we always are behind behind behind 
PBmtg463:516	S2:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:517	S1:	 be- be- because you you asked er it's it's really er th- this email is dated thirtieth of may 
PBmtg463:518	S3:	 yeah it was from may yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:519	S1:	 we started selling in may 
PBmtg463:520	S4:	 i fully agree with you i just wanted to hh to nail it down once again mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:521	S1:	 yes er 
PBmtg463:522	S1:	 if it's we we wou- what would be the ideal thing for us it would be not to give any plan just to 
PBmtg463:523	SX-3:	 yeah but 
PBmtg463:524	S2:	 to wait little more 
PBmtg463:525	S1:	 you cannot 
PBmtg463:526	S4:	 yeah but we have to work with plans because we have to 
PBmtg463:527	S1:	 yes i know 
PBmtg463:528	S3:	 we have to 
PBmtg463:529	S1:	 you have to produce 
PBmtg463:530	S3:	 we even have to give plans where we just er more or less introduce the product even not knowing erm 
PBmtg463:531	S4:	 right 
PBmtg463:532	S2:	 anything 
PBmtg463:533	S3:	 do they like it or do they not like and all our other countries they will not get such budgets you can have 
PBmtg463:534	S4:	 and 
PBmtg463:535	S4:	 and you mustn't forge- right even that's that's true really even er belgium didn't get er your budget so
PBmtg463:536	S3:	 so and and for next year we'll not have this budgets either so 
PBmtg463:537	S4:	 an- 
PBmtg463:538	S4:	 and we must calculate that we need three months of lead time to get the goods from from from [place1] you know and when we spread to all our 
PBmtg463:539	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:540	S4:	 other countries then we really erm need to be very very realistic not to overdo it and not to to save the same to have the same problems like the bracelets 
PBmtg463:541	S1:	 @ where is 
PBmtg463:542	S1:	 when when when when okay to be to be to be on the safe side 
PBmtg463:543	S2:	 mhm

PBmtg463:545	S4:	 muessen wir fragen demnaech- 
PBmtg463:546	S1:	 could could it could it 
PBmtg463:547	S4:	 i think within till end of november 
PBmtg463:548	S1:	 could it could it wait until the end of the year to see the results of the campaign and to see to see 
PBmtg463:549	S3:	 yeah we just can be on the safe side and say okay we bring it down to two hundred fifty thousand pieces

PBmtg463:558	S4:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:559	S1:	 maybe two hun- two hundred fifty thousand would still be too much we don't know and then what happens 
PBmtg463:560	S3:	 mhm

PBmtg463:700	S4:	 mhm

PBmtg463:702	S4:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:703	S2:	 assortment 
PBmtg463:704	S1:	 and if its of any information for you er the average size of a sale point in serbia grocery store and whatever is thirty-five point eight square meters @@@@@ this this this erm this is ridiculous but this is what it is

PBmtg463:710	S4:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:711	S2:	 x xxxx xxxx 
PBmtg463:712	S3:	 then you really really 
PBmtg463:713	S4:	 the the shops around the corner 
PBmtg463:714	S1:	 er yeah er well er by by by the accounts well 
PBmtg463:715	S3:	 carefully think which products you will take 
PBmtg463:716	S1:	 nobody knows er if you take the w- w- we we [S2] and myself we attended a conference organized by [org21] magazine in june and there were there were lectures by three different research and marketing agency [org22] ad- 
PBmtg463:717	S2:	 and analyzing regionally 
PBmtg463:718	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg463:719	S2:	 situation 
PBmtg463:720	S1:	 [org23]- [org23] the marketing board and the third one i don't know who who was the third one hh the the point is all three of them have given different figures
PBmtg463:721	S4:	 @@
PBmtg463:722	S2:	 x of the of the square meters they have 
PBmtg463:723	S1:	 er
PBmtg463:724	S1:	 no the n- the the thing an- no the the thing is that that they still haven't determined what is to be considered as a point of sale in serbia hh 
PBmtg463:725	S2:	 analyzed 
PBmtg463:726	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg463:727	S1:	 because they say because in serbia bakery shops are not point of sale for us because they only sell products made by them for example this is one example hh so 
PBmtg463:728	S4:	 their own yeah 
PBmtg463:729	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:730	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:731	S1:	 personally my opinion is is the the the correct figure 
PBmtg463:732	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:733	S1:	 er of the total universe of small sho- of point of sale in serbia hh is the one that the distributor of [org24] and [org25] and [org26] has 
PBmtg463:734	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:735	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:736	S1:	 which is [org27] and the number is twenty-three thousand
PBmtg463:737	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:738	S1:	 hh there er er this is the total total number so these are the very small ones and the big ones the all of them is around twenty-three thousand 
PBmtg463:739	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:740	S1:	 hh er if you take how many hypermarkets there there are in serbia what you here would call a hypermarket there is not more than ten of them
PBmtg463:741	S4:	 yeah right mhm 
PBmtg463:742	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:743	S1:	 okay hh now the supermarkets there are around four hundred and fifty of them what you will call supermarket 
PBmtg463:744	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:745	S1:	 so meaning a store space a selling space over five hundred square meters and the others are all the others are very very small 
PBmtg463:746	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:747	S1:	 directly out of those twenty-three thousand we cover directly four thousand so far we hope that the number by the end of next year will be around six thousand 
PBmtg463:748	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:749	S1:	 and besides [org27] which is distributor of [org24] and and [org26] and [org25] er we are the only company that covers that many s- points of sales 
PBmtg463:750	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:751	S1:	 points of sale directly er the biggest wholesaling companies in serbia and there are around er one hundred and fifty of them but the biggest one for example [ORG20] has three thousand clients 
PBmtg463:752	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:753	S1:	 and then you have [org13] from belgrade which is around one thousand and and so on we are listed and working with all of them so we think we cover the y- if if if somebody would to do the the [org22] would t- to give us some figures and if to consider tho- those twenty three thousand stores in serbia we think er that he will find [org1] products in about twenty to twenty-one thousand for sure this would be the nun- the the numeric distribution 
PBmtg463:754	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:755	S4:	 because the the rest is covered through the wholesalers yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:756	S1:	 but [org22]- 
PBmtg463:757	S1:	 of course the [org22] the guy from [org22] he was asked a direct question er from some of the participants some- somebody from the public raised his ar- his hand and asked a question 
PBmtg463:758	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:759	S1:	 the guy from [org22] said that he cannot do er er er er sustain- sustainable research 
PBmtg463:760	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:761	S3:	 hm 
PBmtg463:762	S1:	 in serbia because for them he cannot they cannot determine the universe in serbia 
PBmtg463:763	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:764	S1:	 for two reasons they don't know what what how to define what is the point of sale 
PBmtg463:765	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:766	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:767	S1:	 one and second there a lot of stores that open and close the o- th- they just close over night 
PBmtg463:768	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:769	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:770	S1:	 and for them the figure is never safe 
PBmtg463:771	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:772	S1:	 and that that that is that was the answer from the [org22] guy so 
PBmtg463:773	S4:	 yeah but [org22] is many working with the organized trade so erm 
PBmtg463:774	S1:	 for him it's very 
PBmtg463:775	S4:	 that that's that's right 
PBmtg463:776	S3:	 but then it's not clear 
PBmtg463:777	S4:	 that's very logical because they don't work in the out-of-home market and and all these twenty-three 
PBmtg463:778	S3:	 message actually for the 
PBmtg463:779	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:780	S4:	 thousand small shops are the out-of-home market so 
PBmtg463:781	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg463:782	S4:	 they they just measure the organized food er market and that's the ten [org28]- [org28]s and and about er three hundred [org29]s or four hundred and fifty and that's it
PBmtg463:783	S1:	 and that's it
PBmtg463:784	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg463:785	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:786	S4:	 and that's a ver- small universe for them 
PBmtg463:787	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:788	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:789	S4:	 er to measure
PBmtg463:790	S1:	 if if if they measure them then we'll have [thing1] distribution one hundred per cent numeric and rated so 
PBmtg463:791	S3:	 hundred per cent numeric yeah 
PBmtg463:792	S4:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah mhm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:793	S1:	 so it's very it's very it's very easy 
PBmtg463:794	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:795	S1:	 in in that case hh but er th- this is the er the these are the figures so this is why we cannot give you 
PBmtg463:796	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:797	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:798	S1:	 okay these are the [org22] data this is something because they cannot give you the data
PBmtg463:799	S4:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:800	S3:	 yeah no that's fine for us 
PBmtg463:801	S1:	 the thing is the thing is that way to distribution that the participation of m- modern trade in in way to distribution in serbia 
PBmtg463:802	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:803	S1:	 is somewhere between fifteen and twenty per cent hh and tha- th- they gave us the forecast 
PBmtg463:804	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:805	S1:	 and they say that until two thousand eleven th- th- the ratio the proportion will stay the same 
PBmtg463:806	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:807	S1:	 and nothing will change 
PBmtg463:808	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:809	S1:	 and they will say they say that serbia will always be a a market predominantly of the p- the market predominantly er conquered by the small shops and the the the the 
PBmtg463:810	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:811	S1:	 the traditional trade like greece like sou- south italy 
PBmtg463:812	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:813	S1:	 huh well they they gave us a figure 
PBmtg463:814	S4:	 right 
PBmtg463:815	S1:	 in italy that only twenty-eight per cent goes through modern trade which was really astonishing figure so hh 
PBmtg463:816	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:817	S4:	 right mhm 
PBmtg463:818	S3:	 okay then erm one more thing er during our last store checks in er [org30] erm they didn't have the six-packs first and then er the placement was was er also [thing1] was was er placed in the lowest line of the shelf and you told us

PBmtg463:1289	S3:	 no it's not not necessary hh and then bee mov- bee movie as i mentioned before it's also from [org5] and it's er there's the relation with shrek so if we gets the shrek er licence we will have [org5]- er bee movie as well 
PBmtg463:1290	S2:	 aha 
PBmtg463:1291	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg463:1292	S3:	 er the main character is the bee this one 
PBmtg463:1293	S2:	 xx 
PBmtg463:1294	S3:	 barry b benson he lives in a in a beehive and he founds out finds out that er er the the the humans they steal more or less the honey er which is produced by the bees and he would like to change this and he is successful in changing this so 
PBmtg463:1295	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1296	S3:	 nobody takes the honey away anywh- any more and er then you can imagine then there is a big chaos in the hive because there's plenty of honey nobody takes it and er he has to solve 
PBmtg463:1297	S2:	 the problem 
PBmtg463:1298	S3:	 this this chaos and and the problems he caused actually and it's it's december so end of november 
PBmtg463:1299	S1:	 yeah this is the end of the year yeah okay 
PBmtg463:1300	S2:	 end of the year 
PBmtg463:1301	S3:	 and december it's end-of-the-year movie then er we had a packaging relaunch of the mickey mouse and of loony toons so it's a new blister card it's much 
PBmtg463:1302	S1:	 hm hm hm
PBmtg463:1303	S3:	 nicer and and bright it looks like party 
PBmtg463:1304	S1:	 hm hm hm hm hm hm hm 
PBmtg463:1305	S1:	 [org4] is in- is eternal in fact
PBmtg463:1306	S2:	 hm
PBmtg463:1307	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1308	S1:	 it is eternal i mean 
PBmtg463:1309	S4:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:1310	S3:	 so that's what it looks like then er but it's also not finalized at the moment we intend to have er we call it now summer winter collection but even this is not decided yet if we really really will stick on summer and winter flavours hh the idea is to have an additional flavour erm which we maybe when we have in the shops we have the fruit flavour we have maybe cola or sour mix to put one away and for a period of time to bring in new flavours this could be er when we call it summer flavours or winter flavours or we will have a new name
PBmtg463:1311	S4:	 or maybe discovery flavours 
PBmtg463:1312	S3:	 som- discovery flavours 
PBmtg463:1313	S4:	 because we want to change the flavour on the blister pack er every half a year and we want to catch the curious people who are willing to try new flavours 
PBmtg463:1314	S2:	 something new 
PBmtg463:1315	S4:	 er on and on and on so 
PBmtg463:1316	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1317	S4:	 we were not 
PBmtg463:1318	S3:	 that's the main idea 
PBmtg463:1319	S4:	 quite sure yeah yeah 
PBmtg463:1320	S3:	 of this 
PBmtg463:1321	S4:	 how we'll do it because summer and winter is according our opinion a bit dangerous because when the winter fruit mix hh is hanging on the shelf or in the shelf in may i think it's not attractive any more for the consumers so and and don't to have er if if we don't want to have the threat hh i think we should keep it a b- a bit more erm unisex you know to have it there to have it there the whole the whole year 
PBmtg463:1322	S3:	 and not so seasonal-related actually 
PBmtg463:1323	S2:	 hh and so x 
PBmtg463:1324	S2:	 and is it possible that winter fruit has additionally er some vitamins like you have in er your [thing10]s maybe this could be an winter advantage 
PBmtg463:1325	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1326	S4:	 i fully agree with you but er when when we talked to the french people for example they w- they don't want to have vitamins at all 
PBmtg463:1327	S2:	 uhu 
PBmtg463:1328	S4:	 so they they they even say no er so it's it's really er 
PBmtg463:1329	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:1330	S4:	 and when we do it internationally for all of of our partners er it's not so easy to find the right the right decision right right right 
PBmtg463:1331	S2:	 yeah you cannot 
PBmtg463:1332	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1333	S2:	 because in our country i always think of our country which is poor

PBmtg463:1484	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg463:1485	S4:	 because these are our old er layouts or sujets 
PBmtg463:1486	S1:	 yeah

PBmtg463:1641	S4:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg463:1642	S1:	 i don't know how it expensive it would be

PBmtg463:1657	S1:	 rolling stones or whatever 
PBmtg463:1658	S4:	 i'm i have no idea whether they will will this allow of course 
PBmtg463:1659	S1:	 okay elvis presley he's dead but 
PBmtg463:1660	S4:	 but 
PBmtg463:1661	S4:	 right right and we know that we will get the er licence in case we want it

PBmtg463:1663	S4:	 for example 
PBmtg463:1664	S2:	 freddy mercury is very popular 
PBmtg463:1665	S3:	 but beatles they don't 
PBmtg463:1666	S4:	 right 
PBmtg463:1667	S3:	 because they asked already bec- of the beatles they just are er they just allowed to have the

PBmtg463:1674	S4:	 not not not 
PBmtg463:1675	S1:	 doesn't matter 
PBmtg463:1676	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1677	S1:	 well for 
PBmtg463:1678	S2:	 it's interesting to have four different so that everyone picks the the favorite 
PBmtg463:1679	S4:	 yah 
PBmtg463:1680	S4:	 yeah hm 
PBmtg463:1681	S2:	 one 
PBmtg463:1682	S3:	 that's also new what we will have it's a double packaging 
PBmtg463:1683	S4:	 but in general do you think that elvis would be more appealing to 
PBmtg463:1684	S1:	 i think that this wouldn't be appealing at all for our market to be honest 
PBmtg463:1685	S4:	 really 
PBmtg463:1686	S7:	 this is not good this is too small like here 
PBmtg463:1687	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg463:1688	S7:	 must be big 
PBmtg463:1689	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg463:1690	S1:	 well the these are our personal opinions 
PBmtg463:1691	S4:	 we collect personal opinions of course because we are right now at the stage to collect them
PBmtg463:1692	S3:	 yeah sure 
PBmtg463:1693	S7:	 i mean the problem 
PBmtg463:1694	S4:	 and to and to be 
PBmtg463:1695	S7:	 for this is 
PBmtg463:1696	S4:	 at the end of the day a bit wiser 
PBmtg463:1697	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:1698	S7:	 this is er for children and this is for children 
PBmtg463:1699	S4:	 because 
PBmtg463:1700	S4:	 we we also have some different er 
PBmtg463:1701	S7:	 in in the first er first sight 
PBmtg463:1702	S1:	 opinion 
PBmtg463:1703	S4:	 opinions of course and then we start 
PBmtg463:1704	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1705	S1:	 for me 
PBmtg463:1706	S7:	 this is not 
PBmtg463:1707	S4:	 and then we start discussing 
PBmtg463:1708	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:1709	S1:	 and and if you want to do something okay elvis presley yes
PBmtg463:1710	S7:	 if 
PBmtg463:1711	S7:	 you are staring at er 
PBmtg463:1712	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg463:1713	S1:	 but elvis presley is dead and for- 
PBmtg463:1714	S3:	 it's grown-up this is better 
PBmtg463:1715	S1:	 a bit forgotten okay
PBmtg463:1716	S7:	 yes 
PBmtg463:1717	S3:	 this is better 
PBmtg463:1718	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1719	S1:	 to have 
PBmtg463:1720	S2:	 that's why i think four different if it's possible 
PBmtg463:1721	S1:	 but 
PBmtg463:1722	S4:	 yes of course 
PBmtg463:1723	S1:	 but 
PBmtg463:1724	S2:	 four different so that everyone picks it's er favorite 
PBmtg463:1725	S1:	 n- 
PBmtg463:1726	S3:	 it's always going to be x it's 
PBmtg463:1727	S1:	 no no she means four different artists not four different stages of elvis 
PBmtg463:1728	S4:	 aha 
PBmtg463:1729	S3:	 ah okay 
PBmtg463:1730	S4:	 okay okay okay sorry i didn't
PBmtg463:1731	S2:	 four different yeah 
PBmtg463:1732	S1:	 er but a bit more recent artists if i could say i don't know how expensive it would be to put i don't know madonna and er 
PBmtg463:1733	S4:	 hh @
PBmtg463:1734	S1:	 rolling stones and people like that i know it it could be expensive but 
PBmtg463:1735	S2:	 elvis is not very popular in serbia 
PBmtg463:1736	S1:	 elvis is dead forgotten it's been like thirty years since no twenty years 
PBmtg463:1737	S3:	 next year thirty years thirty years next year 
PBmtg463:1738	S1:	 thirty years
PBmtg463:1739	S1:	 thirty years si- since he died so er 
PBmtg463:1740	S2:	 so this would be more attractive for our market as a picture it's something colorful nice ethno african 
PBmtg463:1741	S1:	 if if we choose between elvis and this but not even this is 
PBmtg463:1742	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg463:1743	S4:	 okay
