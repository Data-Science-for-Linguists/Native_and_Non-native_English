PRpan225:25	S4:	 ah 
PRpan225:26	S4:	 i didn't 
PRpan225:27	S1:	 so maybe erm i'd i suggest some topics which i find from from your summary which i find very interesting and give the word to you first of all it it really is true we were talking about canons implicitly all the time but nobody tried to give a definition so maybe some of you even negative or positive or without any value connected tries to either give a definition to what canon means to her or er propose another erm er solution for for this kind of dealing with texts references quotations and things like that what could we use instead of the canon and what is a canon
PRpan225:28	S4:	 okay i will begin by talking about my discipline that is post-colonial xx than theory
PRpan225:29	SX-f:	
PRpan225:30	S4:	 and my idea of what now has become canon is er the names i've already briefly mentioned is habas bebak zaib spillers er and i think several others menhah erm er who else is there the the guy who has written xxxx and there's yanar mohammed so there are several that er no matter how er how er long ago they were written or how far away it is we have to as intellectually conscious beings er challenge them and be challenged by them so i think that that's primary to me in terms of co- er the post-colonial canon to constantly engage with them as we create our own er er definitions and as we create our own er ways of er er er research in it 
PRpan225:31	S1:	 mhm mhm it's [S5] [S5/last] 
PRpan225:32	S5:	 erm really i would like to suggest a differentiation between a canon and this what i call geneal- genealogy gen- genealogie because canon of course er in its in its meaning from bibli- bibl- biblical text has a very strong normative quality and i- it means to have truth a canon in biblical a canon of texts that's truth er whereas er what you described that's not the truth it's a it's er it's er it's consens that are 
PRpan225:33	SX-4:	 yes 
PRpan225:34	S5:	 that are constantly reworked and er that have different truths maybe so this is an maybe a hermeneutic @@ approach to the thing and then i think that canon is not a good word for word for what 
PRpan225:35	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:36	S5:	 we are looking for or what i am looking for 
PRpan225:37	S4:	 yeah 
PRpan225:38	S5:	 because it's absolutely normative a canonical text is 
PRpan225:39	S4:	 yeah 
PRpan225:40	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:41	S5:	 totally normative 
PRpan225:42	S1:	 erm yeah 
PRpan225:43	S4:	 but it's still not s- stable 
PRpan225:44	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:45	S4:	 it's not it's not a non-changing thing it is changeable as we have seen with the next canons 
PRpan225:46	S5:	 yeah 
PRpan225:47	S1:	 so the next one is [S6] and then it's er i think [S8] and then it's over here and yeah 
PRpan225:48	S6:	 i just wanted to say what i understand by canon i i when i studied philosophy for instance there is a whole list of authors beginning er starting with titles of aristotle and plato and xx and xx and then it's continuing with descartes and kant and everything and i met professors who since here it's said that in a seminar or in a in a in a vorlesung what you have to do is to you take one book out of that canon and you make the students read that so it's like you are getting programmed with that erm out of the canon and there's a different approach which i rather prefer it's a an approach like asking a question or erm er turning arou- a- around the problem and looking in different authors from different periods maybe from different erm realms hh what i find in there that helps me erm deal with that problem and that doesn't stick to one author that erm doesn't stick to any canon to any prescribed texts
PRpan225:49	S1:	 er i think [S7] 
PRpan225:50	S6:	 that's what i understand hm 
PRpan225:51	S1:	 just wants to add something to this 
PRpan225:52	S7:	 ah well yes actually i will be adding perhaps hh as someone from literature department 
PRpan225:53	S1:	 approach 
PRpan225:54	S7:	 what i understand from canon is a sort of institution where writers epistemologies concepts are established er disseminated and beca- become stronger for example as er you say a a western canon includes er w- w- writers from aristotle to but the- they are they are chosen and er erm o- in terms of erm establishing the concepts er what i mean is that er for example if you want to understand western modernity you have to got to western canon and read all those writers but also you have to deconstruct them you have to see the two sides of modernity er how the the the person and the other is established in this context again of as a person from literature department we consider that literary canon western canon is a contested space er because it not includes erm erm only western er writers but concepts are established there like er concepts or norms er er a- agai- regarding gender regarding nationalities for example othello most o- most of you most probably have read othello at one time in your lives

PRpan225:58	S7:	 desdemona er in a in a lightful manner asks iago or tells iago oh fie upon thee slanderer iago answers nay it is true or else i'm a turk and at the end when othello commits er suicide he esta- he identifies himself othello black person identifies himself with the malignant and the turban t- turk and he says i w- well he says that he go- he killed someone else because this person er er peak of xxxx and xduced the state so he says i took by the throat the circumcized dog and it is important and smote him thus and upon this identification he kills himself now it is a contested space and that is why i it's it's now being questioned which does not mean that we are questioning shakespeare

PRpan225:64	S8:	 i think what you said is very smart and i don't know what use the two of the words in english but i prefer that er this er remark was very accurate that we were talking about canon all the time and don't say what we mean with it i think we are using a a metaphor of metaphor or something like of course if you go back to the to the encyclopaedia and look up what canon means er by the book er there's a greek etymology which draws on some semitic languages don't know and a canon there means but i doesn't know it's pronounced erm some sort of plan i think it's greek er 
PRpan225:65	SX-7:	 greek measure to measure this

PRpan225:89	S1:	 so [S9] 
PRpan225:90	S9:	 erm probably i was to blame now because er i have perceived this canon erm as a metaphorical way to er design the program and er i just just assumed er it is an assumption that we were speaking about a paradigm and i think that er for the er community of the gender studies people erm it is not that important to have this paradigm it is important that we deconstruct it that in this nonsensical unpractical way er it is important that we are realize that this is not a canon that has to be changed i think that a canon by itself in in a sense as a paradigm in this early classical metaphorical writings by xx robin or thomas kuhn it's a a a set of concepts and a set of statements er where this concepts are used for instance gender is gender or as a rule i mean in physics if you er project this on- onto the social science gender is socially constructed socially constructed and this is a paradigm this is a canon and we er as we as er researchers understand that even if gender is socially constructed you know there are limits to this social construction still have our xxxx sexuality desire er biology a- and so and so and so forth forth therefore i think that this canon is important erm to be produced somehow in canonical books in textbooks for the external usage as a grammar but for the internal erm circulation we have to realize that this is not a canon it has to be changeable modifiable er it has to be volving thank you 
PRpan225:91	S1:	 [S10] is now 
PRpan225:92	S10:	 well er 
PRpan225:93	SX-f:	 and evolving 
PRpan225:94	S10:	 i would like to continue on with @ with canon er s- stop i do believe in this simultaneous strategy of constructing and deconstructing and i would also say i would emphasize again er the problem of disciplines and how er within different disciplines we really have to approach the usual canons differently i would say that in my practice of teaching i was using the exactly the same thing er as [S6] er said i was er arranging around the problems er er er readers and discussions and then i was introduced for me this was very important entry point actually when there was this organization around the problems to introduce eastern european scholars if you like and their scholarships because when you have a problem you can do that er you can simply er have different authors different approaches and i think this is what really brings some kind of richness into the discussion of a problem so i think that as much as it is important to to talk about eventual canons although this is a possible concept which is adding to my discipline in a way er i would say that maybe er it is also important to underline er the im- the constitutive force of method and methodologies and approaches that are used er in gender studies so i would say this is equally important and the third thing i wanted to say was that er although we we have been speaking about canons one way or the other there was also a kind of underlying er er dichotomy here between canon and context
PRpan225:95	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:96	S10:	 and er on the purpose i asked you about how do you contextualize et cetera and i didn't quite er had the chance to to explain @ what do i mean by context at first yesterday but i think er this issue of context and what do we mean by context knowledge you were mentioning also context within this certain context how the gays are shaped within the context we refer a lot to context and we use context as a concept to relativize er a canon so the this is a couple of concepts that we actually need to to think er about er in a joint manner 
PRpan225:97	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:98	S10:	 and finally i really enjoyed your presentation er and i and er er er i think you summarized with one er question my personal er position that i'm having in these last fifteen years when actually i was trying to make sense of er historical unprecedented historical changes that i was repeating and that question is why would she want to do that
PRpan225:99	S1:	 @@@@
PRpan225:100	S10:	 and i think this is exactly my dilemma my dilemma was should i sit in the library and read or should i go into the streets to make the change should i encourage the movement in wem- women's movement in my country and should i try to theorize in the way which would be helpful and useful for women in my circle but thank you 
PRpan225:101	S1:	 so erm before we get over to [S11] i i'd like to add because it fits so well with what you said er the next question you raised one is erm the relationship between institutionalization or maybe er the decision for staying out of the academic institutions and creating some er new space for knowledge production in the feminist field so maybe we can s- switch a little over but first [S11] please 
PRpan225:102	S11:	 starting with this thing of canon i thought it would be quite useful first of course to talk about the sociology of xxxx right er another thing is the orho- erm it is orthodoxy of any field a canon of beauty the canon of er religious pageant the canon of gender studies so it is about our basic er concepts which we as epistemic community share 
PRpan225:103	S1:	 mhm 
PRpan225:104	S11:	 namely it is about power and difference namely this things which er we approach and re-approach and i think so we have core maybe vague ideas that we negotiate and can't or can't which we have to negotiate and to ref- refine contextually but this will be key in our approaches this so this is important to identify core a canon is about our identity and then it is about the borders or x currently stay in english bonded as a border in this case realistic hh who and who are not who do not belong to our old epistemical unity where is this border and those who need to no- negotiate a book yeah xxxxxx 
PRpan225:105	S1:	 er [S16] [S16] 
PRpan225:106	S16:	 so i want to find out to forgot xxxxx provide an answer to you your last er last xx you you suggested er it seems to me that er in the end we're not only questioning questioning canons but concepts as well er a little bit in the light of we suggested here that we are allowed xxx in contexts and we are using on the one hand and concepts on the other and my my reflection is are we not really questioning the whole of science as something as a main production isn't in an i am not xxx that before the end we have to move in in the in the scientific world if er as such as xxxx thus we better but then we have to comply with scientific world and it concept et cetera are we not implicitly quest- questioning that and sa- isn't that the er the internal horizon feminism is er trying to trying to rate hh er i- in a way made of different little concepts on the one hand and the the other hand constantly questioning concepts and allowing this dialogue to accomplish something either this or there always on the move
PRpan225:107	S1:	 [S6] is next so nobody seems to to to erm 
PRpan225:108	S6:	 i want to give a quick answer to er to the question of what 
PRpan225:109	S1:	 yeah yeah yes 
PRpan225:110	S6:	 i think it's not a a question of what should we do either or but we we have to do both in order to keep the contact in between the er theory production and erm and society and er in the streets if you want to and a quick question i wanted to er ask you and and everybody like what do you think of when you think a canon of our own what does that us mean is that we as feminists we as women we as researchers in women studies we as erm gender researchers or still something else

PRpan225:116	S1:	 erm 
PRpan225:117	S1:	 erm no -o first there was [S13] but i er as er did- as it was us i mean [S8] er [S14] and myself who created the conference maybe i just have to explain why you are all here now now that we are at the very end of the conference 
PRpan225:118	SS:	 @@@@@@@@@@@
PRpan225:119	S1:	 erm no it it's exactly the question mark which is the important thing i mean er the question mark means what is a canon who is the we behind the possible canon and do we need such a thing so it's the three very complex questions why we're all here and why it's so difficult hh to find conclusion but that's the the most exciting thing for me at least that it stays like that so [S13] please 
PRpan225:120	S13:	 yeah i just wanted to make a comment on the institutionalization versus the activism erm i completely a- agree that now that we have to keep both we have to we have to erm i mean point is research involves activism er if not taken to the streets xxx where it can be applied as well it definitely erm is activism within the sciences and the reason i think it's crucial to continue the project of feminist research m- most of us have xxx in feminist epistemologies is because it continues to reveal the political engagement of entire knowledge production not only of our own very specific feminist knowledge production but the way we do it and the way we point to er what all the different aspects that can be political not in the sense of political as in politics but political as in engaged is precisely that all science is engaged in this way and it tries to conceal that kind so by pointing there i think that we are doing a huge service to the sciences as a whole and it's and it's necessary for the transformation of what we consider knowledge and how that is produced and then it can only hopefully have a xxx when xxx on er feminist researchers as that as well hm 
PRpan225:121	S1:	 mhm er it's it's [S10] again 
PRpan225:122	S10:	 er i erm i i wa- be- er because i forgot to say that also it really makes a huge difference whether you are er dominantly in teaching position or in a research position because if you are teaching you actually have to rely on on you have to define or you have to rely on already defined canons and it's a very different position then if you're for example sociologist doing a research and then you realize that much of what has been written is simply irrelevant or misguided so this is a a very different position
