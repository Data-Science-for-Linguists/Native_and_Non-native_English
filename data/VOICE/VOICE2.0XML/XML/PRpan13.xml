            <note xml:id="PRpan13_tn_0">This panel discussion takes place at the end of a two-day
               conference on gender and politics. S1 chairs the session. S2, S3, S11 and S13 give
               scripted presentations, which are long monologues and therefore not transcribed. The
               rest of the session is dedicated to discussion with the other conference participants
               and with the audience. The themes and questions that are discussed relate to gender
               studies, the position of women in different societies, reproduction and family
               policies and related issues. At the beginning of the panel, S2 and S3 give their
               papers. Afterwards there is a long stretch of discussion and then a short coffee
               break. The panel continues after the coffee break with S11's and S13's papers and
               again an extensive stretch of discussion follows, which concludes the conference. </note>
