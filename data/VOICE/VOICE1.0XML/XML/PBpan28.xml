er we feel that er <pause/> the margins er are hi- are quite high on this markets  and that <pause/><emph> though </emph> er we we are prepared to <supplied reason="unintelligible"> xx </supplied>

e<c type="lengthening"/>r <vocal voice:desc="clears throat"/> basically <pause/> er <vocal voice:desc="clears throat"/> that will <pause/> also give <pause/> banks <pause/> er <emph> more </emph> more
