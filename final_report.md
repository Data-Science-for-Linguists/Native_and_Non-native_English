## Introduction
### Motivation
Even after year of studying and speaking a foreign language and gaining proficiency in the language, very few people become completely native-like. Accents and pronunciations of words are often the most noticable difference between native and non-native speakers. However, there are also other, more subtle differences, like the choice of words and phrases and sentence structure. In this project, I explore some of these differences between native and non-native English speakers.
### Overview of the Data
I used two different corpora in this project: The Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE) and the British National Corpus (BNC).  
The Vienna-Oxford Interntational Corpus of English (VOICE) contains 150 conversations between people from different first language backgrounds who use English as a common language. Overall, the corpus contains about 1 million words. Across all of the conversations, there are 1253 participants representing 50 different L1s (including English). VOICE was compiled Vienna, so (naturally) the vast majority of the speakers speak European languages as L1s. The wide variety of languages did provide a lot of opportunities for intriguing analysis, but having a greater number of participants with L1s from different language families could have been particularly interesting.
The British National Corpus (VOICE) is much larger than the VOICE; it contains over 100 million words. However, around 90% of the corpus consists of written data, while only about 10% consist of spoken data. Since I compared the BNC to the VOICE (a spoken corpus), I could only use a small portion of the BNC.
