PBpan581:1	S1:	 i've i've been with the [org1] for the last couple of years but before that i was ten years with the [org2] so our host and i share some er common experience from from our past there and going back even further i i started my career a bit similar to xx er in the [org3] in my case of denmark er but with that let's let's get started on the on the substance of the discussion i i will just say a few words as as background and then starts with the panel er to pick up some of the questions tha- that have been identified er and after that i guess open up for a general discussion now what are the demographic prospects er in central europe er well there are a number of of different phenomena at at play here one is is very low fertility rates erm er currently lower than what would be needed to replace er the people who die and as a result er we have a a process of a declining population i believe in all the countries er in the region erm in fact if we look at the er the new member states from central europe and the baltic countries fertility rates are as far as i know less than one and a half child per mother which compares to a a world average of somewhere between two and a half and three so really only about half the fertility rate er that prevails at the global level now in order to replace those who die you would need er i think fertility rates a bit over two so we're well short of that and in fact in some of the countries in the region such as latvia slovenia and the czech republic er as far as i know are actually among the the lowest ten in the world in terms of fertility rates now as mention this er is and will be associated with a steady decline of of populations er by two thousand and fifty potentially the neighborhood of one third of the existing population er the decline will be around one third of the existing population there is some variation er i think in the case of slovenia it may be relatively modest perhaps around ten per cent but in other countries 
PBpan581:2	SX-m:	
PBpan581:3	S1:	 such as estonia the figures are much higher potentially around fifty per cent now that in combination with increasing life expectancy and i think most estimates are for somewhere around five six years over the next er forty-five er fifty year period the population will inevidently er age rather quickly and by by the middle of the century the c- the central european region will er have one of the oldest populations in the world in some countries such as slovenia latvia estonia and the czech republic with a median age of above fifty and these countries will again be in the top ten globally er in terms of of age of the population now this evolution is is by definition associated with an increasing old age dependency ratio which is purely demographic phenomenon that measures the the share of people er above retirement age let's say sixty-five er to the share of of working age people between fifty and sixty-four typically er this old-age dependency ratio in the region is now somewhere around twenty er between twenty and thirty per cent and will more than double er most likely by the middle of the century and in some cases will even be above fifty per cent er there're cases where it's likely to be even higher than sixty or seventy per cent now the implications of this are obviously potentially enormous pressures on public finances pension systems self-spending et cetera
PBpan581:4	SX-f:	 drinking as well 
PBpan581:5	S1:	 and in fact i mean as as i think i'm sure you all know i mean this is not a phenomenon that is unique to central europe it is more or less a global phenomenon but it is more pronounced in europe 
PBpan581:6	SX-m:	 @
PBpan581:7	S1:	 and within europe er i think even more pronounced in in central europe than in western europe although the process will kick in a little bit later because of of currently shorter life expectancy in in that region the question is what what can be done what has been done what more needs to be done and i'll will just mention a few points an- and other panellists i'm sure will elaborate on these one obvious point is to increase labor force participation rates including through encouraging er immigration er some countries in the region such as hungary have extremely low labor force participation rates around fifty-four fifty-five compared to other o e c d countries such as the u s which are around sixty-five sixty-six at the same time employment rates will need to be increased including not least of all the workers er and there's a lot of discussion now of of lifelong learning programs and will enable the older people er the elder people to remain in the labor market for a longer period of time at the same time potentially raising further the retirement ages not just statutory retirement ages but also effective retirement ages a lot of people retire early er so that's another possibility er another way is to enhance the link between contributions and pensions that are subsequently received and finally er encouraging various forms of voluntary er private saving er for retirement what has been done most countries in the region have implemented begun implementing reforms of of their pension systems er i think they're less advanced on health care reforms but certainly on pensions quite a lot has been done some countries have moved to mixed pension systems introducing mandatory private pension savings and or er the third pillar was the voluntary private er pension savings so all countries have looked at their current pay as you go systems made various reforms er xx all 
PBpan581:8	SX-m:	
PBpan581:9	S1:	 have implemented these comprehensive pension reforms and even the ones that have moved to mixed systems probably have more to do in terms of sys- er insurance sustainability er in the long term of their pay as you go systems 
PBpan581:10	SX-m:	
PBpan581:11	S1:	 so with that er let me turn er i guess first to [S2] [S2/last] to discuss a little bit what he sees er in more detail the implications of a public finances er he may also have a view on the the realism or the possibility of of these long-term demographic projections i think that would also be useful er after that we will turn to er i think go to talk a little bit about the implications for the private sector what what the private sector is doing now to address these challenges and then finally to yah to talk a little bit about some of the institutional implications er there's an e u pension director and also how he sees the implications for the management of of er pension funds so with that let's start with [S2] 
PBpan581:12	S2:	 er thank you [S1] er let me make essentially three three points erm the world's er population by two thousand and twenty will be close to eight billion er people this is actually a relatively good estimate because most of the mothers who will have er er these additional two billion babies have already been born er [first name1] [last name1] a professor at [name1] university in referring to this forecast makes the following point he says it would lay extraordinary efforts of a nature and magnitude not generally contemplated altered this demographic projections significantly so at the xx bit level actually there was going to be a lot more of us erm in by two thousand and twenty than than xx would be over decade erm d- but that is two thousand and twenty projections for two thousand and fifty are much less certain because there is no reliable way of forecasting hh how many babies they are more we'll be we'll be having er i've been having some interesting discussions with [first name2] [last name2] who is a very well known er demographer perhaps one of the world's leading experts in this area and i was telling him a few days ago i'm coming to this conference in [place1] do you have any any er interesting insights and this is one of the key points that he was making that in fact it is really very difficult to attach hh er much much er er certainty to to the to the pr- to to as conservative projections as to say that the population of the central eastern european countries will be in twen- twenty per cent less than today by two thousand and fifty er second point erm er er you of course there's a huge gap in wages between er central european countries and what you might call the further old er er europe countries er germany france spain and so on hh and other things we equal putting fertility rates aside this means that there will actually be very powerful incentives for out migration from central and eastern europe to other european countries er and this i would expect will be happening for the foreseeable future in other words what economists called factual price equalization will be very much er erm be a feature of er economic relationships in the enlarged europe for the for the nex- for the next decade also hh and it will be fuelled by the ongoing process of integration itself there're coming down barriers and the gradual emergents of a truly sinking market so erm there are powerful economic factors at work which are actually likely to lead to population decline in central and eastern europe er furthermore er and i think that the following two points are very important hh erm it is likely that old european countries er to establish a distinction with with the new hh are likely to be friendly to this to this process of immigration into the countries from poland from hungary and from some of these other countries essentially because many of these countries italy spain germany and so on as you will know need migrants because of the of the trends that er [S1] has mentioned er but there's yet another factor as to why i think that they would probably welcome er immigration from central eastern europe and that is that er as we know in many of the european countries at the moment hh er policy makers and their xxlities are a little bit spooked about er er what we would call euro-islam er in other words the prospects in germany er in spain and italy of having migrants from poland and hungary i would guess are probably relatively more attractive than to have you know vast er migrants from from morocco or from erm you know a mid mid-eastern or north african region er and if you don't believe that then then sort of read the the n- the the press in in in the netherlands and the kind of internal debate that is taking place in the country hh er following the the recent murder of er mister van gogh hh er there is yet another factor that is likely to play a role if you accept that wage differentials in in between central eastern europe and old europe are likely to prevail for some time hh and that is that erm i would expect that remittances will play hh er a very important role in lo- in the local economic life of erm of central eastern european economies in the same way that remittances played a very important role in turkey and in spain you know in the nineteen sixties and the nineteen seventies er this is something that likewise is likely to have obligations for you know overall fi- er finances in in the country let me make one final er somewhat longer point having to do with the public finances it is the case that because of population ageing erm and other process is by the way not just population ageing climate change globalization all of these will put er increasing pressures on budgets and it is entirely reasonable to ask you know what is the appropriate policy response in what way could governments er prepare themselves for this coming hh er sort of long-term xx crises er first point to make here is that some countries are already doing this erm if you look at the public finances of countries like finland and norway these countries have already for a number of years been running budget surpluses er and they are doing it largely because they have recognized that population ageing is a serious problem er the politicians and the societies have somehow or less around the view that there is a certain sense of responsibility that is owed to future generations and so these countries are saving money now so that they will be able to meet their pension liabilities in the future i find this admirable i think i i i wish that we had this kind of er political maturity in some of the other countries where this is not being done er italy france er and beyond europe places like china and and so on hh er now in terms of you know how one might one approach the public finances ahead of this feasible crisis there are several steps that come to mind one of them is that you know countries need to develop a clear picture of what is their long-term fiscal health in other words governments need to study publish a kind of a base line as to where the public finances are today and this involves er spe- specifically looking at the primary balance which means the deficit net of interest payments and then asking yourself as a policy maker as a finance minister whether er if this primary balance were to be maintained the public that is going to rising or is going to be falling or or is going to be broadly stable over time hh er this seems like a very erm unambitious proposal but it is a starting point it doesn't tell you very much about the structure of expenditure it doesn't tell you very much about where your problems lie hh but it's a kind it's a kind of a minimalist first step that countries have to do i regret to tell you that many of the er advanced european countries are not doing this even this and that in fact public dead levels throughout the o e c d which of course includes the european union are having on the rise are pretty much across the board erm beyond that what countries need to do they need to brawl in their analysis and consider hh what i would call implicit debts debts which are a function of the long-term policy commitments which do not appear in the governments books today and of course the classic case is pensions er typically what happens with pensions is that you record the revenue collected from the contributions in the budget today that appears as part of your general government operations but you don't record the future liabilities because they're future they will be appearing later on when people retire and this is what tends to basically to give give 
PBpan581:13	SX-m:	
PBpan581:14	S2:	 government an incentives for for looking at at at the public finances with a kind of a short-term short-term perspective erm not many governments are actually doing this in a in a in a consistent way erm beyond the pensions there is a need to also consider the possible impact over the longer term of what we call other contingent liabilities this means er you know things like government guarantees on on state enterprise debt that means er the positive insurance hh it means thinking about certain other p- pre- trends in in the world which could potentially have implications on the public finances down the line er climate changes are very very important er factor which people are not factoring they're not looking at erm the scientific the scientific er consensus is that climate change will have a very important fiscal implications it they're they're uncertain it is not clear but we already see it we've seen it in the last few weeks in in in asia hh erm we will see in other places where where in- increasingly you will see extreme weather conditions and so on and of course the the the the er the budget will have to pick up the implications of this hh erm one er final point is that governments should seriously reconsidering consider introducing some kind of fiscal rules to to constrain er political pressures better you know to provide incentives political incentives for governments to essentially behave hh in a more fiscally responsible way if your political i- if if the political establishment does not have a maturity of a country like finland which does this willingly and out of political consensus then you need to tie your hands and need to come up with some kind of fiscal rule er a very good example of a fiscal rule that has been working extremely well is is that one used in chile erm incidentally i'm not chilean so as i as i'm about to praise this fiscal rule just bear that in mind 
PBpan581:15	SX-m:	
PBpan581:16	S2:	 er the chileans have a a fiscal policy with essentially limits expenditure to a cyclically adjusted revenue so it's an even harder a harder er rule than xxx rules in a stability pact in in europe which of course as you will know hasn't worked really well and essentially what the chileans have been able to do is to reduce public debt levels from a hundred per cent of g d p er fifteen years ago to twelve per cent of g d p today they have one of the soundest public finances in the world er i think the countries should actually actively actively learn from from from the lessons of other countries that have done this well you know the finlands and the norways and the swedens a- and the chiles of this of this world hh and then finally i think countries should seriously consider as part of this sort of this preparation for the coming fiscal prices to establish some kind of separate independent perspective on the budget er to maintain competence erm part of the problem is that if you leave it entirely to the government erm er to basically tell the population and the public where the public finances are hh you may not always get the right the right picture when you have something like the congressional budget office in the united states or some other m- semi or quasi-independent body that can tell you er the state or the public finances in the long-term perspective than you you you have taken a very important step towards you know beginning to to look at this problem seriously thank you 
PBpan581:17	S1:	 thank you very much for that and so 
PBpan581:18	S3:	 oh thank you very much f- x i would rather turn for the moment away from the big macro issues xx colleagues were talking about and i'm concentrating more on the micro study case in xxx small central european country of slovakia which is actually at the moment tackling its pension er reform as a way to tackle the er diversions demographic xx xx not favorable demographic developments and er introduced the country's j- it's just introduced its pension reform basically setting out a mandatory pension pillar to the pension system so from the beginning of this year there'll be three pillars in slovakia to cover for the old-age provision the first 
PBpan581:19	SX-m:	
PBpan581:20	S3:	 which is the state xxxx system or the leaner version of it the second the mandatory pension pillar the third is the voluntary pension pillar er how can private sector contribute indeed it is the involvement in funding the second mandatory pension pillar and provide for the voluntary household savings in the third pillar and other long-term household savings now speaking for the b- bank i work for the [org5] bank we are actually actively involved in the pension business so here a here a case where private company indeed takes an active part in helping to solve the long-term er demographical issue and the by this basically not only is the maximal are shoulder available by establishing a business which in our view will be profitably in the longer term but as a side or side effects we also provide for the xx 
PBpan581:21	SX-m:	
PBpan581:22	S3:	 public x helping to er alleviate demographic issue by allowing households to save for pensions and obviously by doing so we hope to be providing mo- better or superior returns not only to the state pension system but also to the 
PBpan581:23	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBpan581:24	S3:	 competitors mandatory pensions our mandatory pensions funded by the private sector managed by the private sectors are obviously not the single or the solution which is solve the problem and so speaking from the households' point of view again from the micro side erm the system in slovakia as currently stands raises two issues who will benefit from entering the second mandatory pension pillar and actually as the system stands the research by the minister of finance shows that people actually women older than thirty-five years of age and men older than forty years of age would probably not better off are entering the mandatory pension pillar simply because the first pillar is still set so xx xx that it provides relatively good return or or we should say promises for relatively good returns for the pension in the future so now the issue is if people will not be better off entering the second pension pillar what can they do to save for the for the pensions for the old age and there i see actually the role of the banks to step in and provide other forms and long-term savings with long-term pension savings or with other forms of erm caring for households er the long term for national assets beyond pensions we are talking just before the panel begun the other issue where the private sector can step in tackling the unfavorable demographic low point is to look at ways to employ older older workers older employees but for the time being actually in slovakia there is rather a different issue because most of the employees are the young the first c- newcomers to the labor market so for the time being a more urgent issue to tackle slovakia's high unemployment rate xx still got the ways to employ er the very young people that first come to the labor market maybe later on for the discussion thank you very much 
PBpan581:25	SX-1:	 thank you very much xx yah
PBpan581:26	S4:	 oh erm let me say a few things about the er structure on challenges pension forms are facing erm not only in the er the xx countries but er all over the world hh erm we see a number of specific erm er challenges first of all the ageing society and we have talked much about this erm longevity which is er a a a which is different erm let me just give you an example within erm er [org6] erm the er the average age has increased erm with about six month for men and and three month for er for women hh and er what meant that we had to put in an an additional five billion euros in our pension fund to indeed account for longevity this is a indeed a phenomenal amount of money low inflation and low returns er low interest rates erm er low interest rates i think are the worst the worst possible enemy of erm of pension funds er we have seen significant so of er er drops in in interest rates over the past at the past few years every percentage point of interest rates means that your xx validities increased erm by about er fifteen per cent so for example we made er [org6] made around twelve per cent er of the last year on its er asset makes but at the same time interest rates dropped and our assabil- liability ratio still remains the same so it's very difficult also to explain to your pensioners and er to your to your members but er er that w- that we still have to increase er pension fund contributions hh er in spite of the fact that on the erm on the er return side er we have been very successful i a s the international accounting standards er simply meaning but the cover ratios have to be reflected in in into the books of the er hh of the of the companies erm and again that's that that's considered if you like a time bomb and er and a xx as systems hh all the chances needed obviously are the increase of the retirement age er erm lower benefits and and un- er a combination lower benefits and higher premiums hh er but again er timing is here of the essence because most er most countries of the same time face a various high unemployment er currently in the u in the u in the e u we are talking about a an unemployment rate of around nine per cent so again erm er timing is xxous and o- of the essence here erm better cost control meaning no blank checks no er inconditional indexation promise no open ended arrangements i'm still surprised to see that many countries hh erm including the the er the fifteen er er er er the first the first fifteen er e m e e u members hh that are many sort of unkept er er pension pension promises er and no er no no no form of er of of er er er er conditional indexation again we also er see erm erm er a move from final pay to er to d b based x can be average onto to hybrid x systems certainly in the er in the in the new extension countries hhh erm yeah what what is the key to successful pension management obviously er a proper a l m er management asset liability management er is the key proper cost control and again as i've been er saying er to you er no un- un- unkept indexation promises i think in the end that will kill pension funds hhh erm on the issue of er of pension reform erm the er the object of of the er of the pension fund director er was really erm er fourfold first of all the liberalization of investment practice and the introduction of the er prudential standard on er on er based on er the xx x principle erm third be er er croft board of membership er further a flaws board of membership and the protection of beneficiaries erm to achieve these objectives er the e u er pension fund directive has set minimum conditions for operations hh er introduced er er prudent er principles are granted er powers to supervisors based on the er the home states erm er er control er concept and introduced er cross-border procedures er my main concern actually er er in regard to er to er the erm er e u pension fund directive hh is er that er it still allows erm er for erm er er more common restrictions erm and er the issue of taxation is is is going to be er erm erm an important one erm although i'm happy to see that most er new accession countries er have have also have the e t er er concept of er of taxation hh er an old issue for most new member er states will be er the information er requirements to members a- and and beneficiaries this is set out very specifically in the e u erm er er pensions directive er pan-european pension funds will be quite an interesting one erm and er perhaps even more importantly er the issue of full funding er will be er a key issue in pension funding directive er currently there's an institution called [org9] the er committee on the european insurance and occupation pension supervisors that is looking at actually er making more concrete er recommendations on what full fu- full funding er means but in sum are x argued the challenges to er not only if you like the the the new obsession er er countries but also at the present the the the the the first fifteen er er erm e u members thank you 
PBpan581:27	S1:	 thanks a lot er [S4] we now have approximately fifteen minutes i think for for general discussion i i think there're certainly two issues that that i would be very interested in in hearing more about from from anyone who may has good ideas one one is the issue of sort of a large debate about so called active retirement which sort of er the idea is to move away from this one point er 
PBpan581:28	SX-m:	
PBpan581:29	S1:	 retirement and work full-time until you're sixty-two or sixty-three or sixty-five and then you retired and moving more towards a a system of of gradual retirement where people potentially can work they can slow down they can work part-time they potentially continue er until they are sixty-seven or seventy so that's one idea the other idea is is what can be done to insure that there is a demand for for older people to remain in the in the labor market in terms of of lifelong learning programs er potentially providing incentives for keeping er the older people in er in their jobs i think these are some of the the key issues er as i as i see it but it's a general and open discussion so any comments or questions are are more than welcome
PBpan581:30	S5:	 er my name is [S5] [S5/last] i'm an austrian auditor i've got two questions one is er apparently we all will be forced to save more now will that have a negative impact on the economy because people we all will have to spend less and save more and th- the second question is is there any country which tries to change the demographic er development
PBpan581:31	SX-1:	 thank you 
PBpan581:32	S1:	 i think erm start with directing that one to er [S2] er and potentially er [S4] will also have something to say on on another part of the question then 
PBpan581:33	S2:	 well i guess there there are some examples of countries that are trying to er er have an impact on demographic developments er china is the one that immediately comes to mind although i'm not sure that we could recommend chinese policies in in central eastern europe they are largely re- to regarded as xx being er er unduly tough er er and certainly condition conditional on having a particular kind of government which er which we no longer have in er in this part of the world erm in terms of er the impact of savings on on the economy i think the the effect is likely to be ambiguous i don't think you can say xxx erm i think that er you know er for the population to save more i- it tends to be very good it it means that there is a larger pool of of of of savings which can be hh which can be directed to to you know profitable er investment outlets erm i think that this has to be seen the issue of savings and the issue of of er er the fiscal implication so population ageing hh how to be seen less in terms of what the impact is on the you know short-term aggregate demand and have and more in terms of what is the the er you know what is in the best long-term interest of the country in terms of the structure of the public finances 
PBpan581:34	S4:	 erm yes i i like to say a few words about er broadening if you like to pace for er for employment erm having lived a a number of live in the far east er i i really feel that we can learn a lot from the far east in regard to providing er proper ch- childcare facilities i think the key perhaps to to to er to getting if you like er stimulating more babies er so to speak is is providing better childcare facilities and i'm really quite serious here erm because that is certainly in in in most countries is is not well organized in in the u in the e e u as far as i as far as i can can can see er and getting more women into in- into jobs er the best way to stimulate er that is what i mean by by er providing er more childcare and if you by more and better childcare there're definitely er er more stimulated to get more babies i think that's really the way forward but in most countries that is really overlooked and it's very difficult to get proper childcare facilities and those that are are too expensive are are are overbooked and i think really there there's real a real challenge as far as i'm concerned here to er to do a better job 
PBpan581:35	S1:	 er xxxx i like just just that maybe i add a a few points er i think on the first point i i do think there is a bit little bit of truth to that story at least in the short medium term that that i r savings can have an impact on growth but and i think maybe you have seen that in germany and other places right now in in in western europe people are concerned about the longer term prospects er of their social benefits and then are probably er saving more right now and spending less but but i think that's a short medium term issue i think in the longer term as [S2] says it's i mean there's complementarily been savings and investment you won't have that the needed investment without without the savings i think on the second issue to the best of my knowledge i mean there may be some good examples of countries that have managed to affect fertility rates in a downward direction such as china but the other way which is really the issue here raising fertility rates is to my knowledge there had there're no very there're not any very good examples of countries that have have managed to do this with any big impact i mean these are things that are very difficult to change and and probably likely to change quite slowly over the longer terms so i mean i do agree that there is a lot of uncertainty about the issue of fertility rates but i think if you look at the evidence it it er that that would suggest that it's not something that's gonna change rapidly erm but o- one other point which which i think may be worth thinking about is i i do agree that improving childcare facilities is is a key component but i think er another way is to think more about er various types of of less than full-time employment er for one or the other er married couple that i know in the country i where i come from [place2] it's i mean it's basically you work full-time or you or you don't work at all and if both parents are working full-time it's you just don't have the resources and and i think more flexible working arrangements is another is another way to go that may stimulate actually er but i think [S2] xxx before erm 
PBpan581:36	S2:	 erm it it occurs to me that that erm when you look at the at the world at large you know that is a region that is close to europe which is middle eastern north africa hh that has exactly the reverse problem of of er of the e u hh er they have some of the largest rates of population growth they have er the largest er rate of growth of the labor force er the [org1] has done some calculations which show that hh er just to keep the rates of unemployment in the middle eastern north african region at present levels they need to create something like eight eight eight million jobs between now and two thousand and twenty hh they have very young populations and so on so one possible way to tackle the the problems say of of er the pe- the pension problem in a country like italy is to allow a fairly significant inflow of migrants from some of these countries you know from morocco and from algeria and from egypt and from many of the arab countries as well now you may think you know that's not but that's a non-starter that is not likely to happen and er you know for obvious for obvious reasons i myself and my xx x reminds refer to to to the concerns about about the the the e- euro what we call we what we might call euro-islam hh but but if you could if you could somehow in some miraculous way @@ you know come up with a with a with a value system that would allow for the peaceful sort of gradual integration of different societies er in a way that was constructive and that was er that was er you know relatively free of inter-ethnic tensions and so on then this is the way to solve the problem it is basically to have managed carefully carefully worked out er mi- migratory flows from the middle east and north africa into into western europe er that wou- that would certainly fix a lot of the pension systems i assure you i share this with you just to support 
PBpan581:37	S4:	 er may- maybe maybe to to expand er a a bit on the point an- and to give you a few a few examples i lived in the middle east and the far east for a considerable number of time hh an- er and talking about fu- sort of full-time babysitters they they import in most of these countries either either filipino or indian or or or or other sort of full-time er babysitters to to look after their children so everybody can work and it's not only the rich but it is made average er er er paid men as well erm and th- that combinates er that's a combination of if you like to er er the best a- as far as i i i can see there
PBpan581:38	S1:	 i think that gentleman on the right first and then we have another question here
PBpan581:39	S6:	 the question concerning to the ferterti- fertertility rate of women er we have very low rates right now but is there not a a a delay effect of that women right now have birth later than er in former years but when they go to let's say forty er a lot of them er again get er children so is it really the the pure statistics er you say or can you er is that er in some extent er calculated that 
PBpan581:40	SX-m:	 xx 
PBpan581:41	S1:	 i i've a list here with all the statistics er a- and but these are the- these are the statistics as far as as we can can can can can s- can see now i don't know wha- what happened in in in twenty-five years down the road but indeed 
PBpan581:42	S6:	 yah but w- we compare figures right now to ninety sixty at ninety sixty the average birth took place in the age of twenty-five and now it takes place at thirty and women have time let's say to forty-two or something like that so er

PBpan581:44	S6:	 that the fertertility also the the the children er the birth rate had come down but it's not said that there're the ways er the the point is i bet 
PBpan581:45	S1:	 well i i i do think that that that that issue is taken into account in the projection cos i mean you're looking at and you can see sort of how many children are women now at the age of let's say forty to forty-five having now or thirty-five to forty-five having now so that i mean that information is available there is always uncertainty about the future and what will happen in the future but you do have and you do know what is going on with fertility rates at that age group currently
PBpan581:46	S4:	 er er to to give you a few examples the highest fertility rate at the moment er maybe people get mistaken about this is is is is in again not in the roman catholic countries but is in er in er in like li- like in greece or or er or italy or spain but is is ireland one point nine er er france er one point nine er norway one point eight erm the netherlands one point seven denmark one point eight and the lowest indeed is in th- in spain and italy er the czech republic er hungary and poland and er slovakia one point two one point three hhh quite interesting now that for example the netherlands one point seven tha- that that has to do with immigration or political xxx usually 
PBpan581:47	S1:	 is another question here 
PBpan581:48	S7:	 erm i'm with you when you say er tha- that the problem can be solved er by an immigration model hh but i don't see that any country of the old the european countries or the new european countries hh er is going towards this direction erm i'm asking why not especially the eastern european countries er have good connections er to er countries like ukraine or russia hh where i think a lot of people would er like to to er be immigrants er to these countries and the western european countries are protecting er their own er labor force erm through erm transition models er so that er erm from the new members er the people are not allowed er er to have er the freedom where hh wherever they want to work for the next years and i think er we should er er talk about er such er er immigration models like a green card models to get high potentials hh er which er would er work here and i think er turkey if turkey would be a member er or become a member of the european union with er this er sixty-five or seven- er -ty million people who are able to pay our pensions in the future i think we should talk about that also
PBpan581:49	S4:	 well i i i agree very much with you er but i think it's just a matter of time and that's simply is is is a reflection of the high unemployment at the moment in the e u we're talking about nine or between nine and ten per cent but i think in a few years down the road erm when the dependency ratio er will indeed si- si- sig- significantly change then we will see more immigration just a qued- a a matter of time as far as i can see but not at the moment simply aren't our jobs in mo- in most of these in most of these countries i mean it it looks fairly logical for people to move say to poland with a very low er er fertility ratio but in poland for example the unemployment ratio is well above the ten per cent is ten fifteen per cent but say in in ten years down the road the picture might completely change so i'm i'm optimistic about the future but as yet indeed you are absolutely right erm not a lot of people are moving er er er in in in the direction 
PBpan581:50	S1:	 yeah i i i mean i i agree i think and that's perhaps the difference between now and the sixties where there was a a similar or er a pro- probably less er sizeable er problem but at that time there was quite a lot of inflow of of labor from exactly those countries i mean from the middle east and north africa so a lot of western european countries but unemployment rates at that time were were low or not existent i mean there was a a distinct shortage of labor and that's not really the situation right now so you do have a problem over the medium term of a- addressing the current unemployment problem in in- enhancing the x for labor and i think before that happens it's it's unlikely that you'll see sizeable flows but but subsequently i mean i don't see why not assuming that somehow the social tensions that have arisen from er from the importation of labor er some time ago are resolved which is obviously the the big if but but otherwise i i do think that there is a significant potential

PBpan581:52	S8:	 er [S8/last] [org8] i don't have a question but just a comment on er what you hh er elaborated i think you said everything which could be said on this subject because all these things are known we know about longevity we know about er unemployment we know all these things the main problem is i think is how politics behaves in this question because we have two things one is the short-term sight what he mentioned for example unemployment hh er protecting labor force a- against immigrants or whatever or the other thing ha- having er retirement postponement when when not having hundred per cent activity maybe fifty and having this like er [place4] association is working on this fourth pillar system idea et cetera the m- biggest problem is really politics when i started my career in seventy-four the famous doctor [last name4] maybe you know this person it was a a great actuary in germany he mentioned that the er so security contribution at that time will exceed soon one thousand deutschmarks at that time this was almost third times as much as possible time because we saw already from this population tree there were these the the the killed people f- during the war the not born child et cetera and this has this long-term effect and the biggest problem is really politics that they if you are discussing on an expert level everyone knows these things and there are some remedies to solve these problems but politics really gave presence without funding things and promises and having n- no funding for it and i think this is the biggest problem that they are not aware even if there are some politicians now in some circles are a little bit more aware of this situation and especially the lacks the time lacks in this situation but there i think is the biggest er problem in the the biggest challenge for experts like you and the people who are in financial services et cetera second pillar systems xx to re- to really to promote this and to trying to avoid that er that they make things which could not be financed which could be not covered and er responsible for that this is my comment on that 
PBpan581:53	S1:	 i i think we i'm sure we all agree that that at the end of the day it's er it is a political issue but not perhaps more much more so than an issue of understanding what the prospects are or and er i think and at least in principle some of [S2]'s ideas i think of institutionalizing some of these fiscal forms and enforcing some way of taking into account the long term i mean the fiscal prospects is is sounds like the right way to go but again it's getting that to happen is is not gonna be easy as as as you see so i think with that and i think we've come to the end of of our time so thank you very much everyone and
