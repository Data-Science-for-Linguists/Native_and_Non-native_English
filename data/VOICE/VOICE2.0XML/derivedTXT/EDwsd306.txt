EDwsd306:1	S6:	 after that we erm we'll have the short presentations of each subgroup one person shortly explains which you have chosen as your most likely your worst case and your desirable scenario and your reco- your basic recommendation doesn't have to be long so try to do it shortly in two minutes because we have a time problem a little bit erm after that i will explain how we will move on with the making of the final presentation okay we will divide you again and explain who has to do what for the final presentation is it clear so far okay then i would like to ask group one to already give your er recommendations 
EDwsd306:2	S7:	 shall i just sit here or 
EDwsd306:3	S6:	 that's fine as well because now everybody can see each other so 
EDwsd306:4	S7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:5	SX-f:	 can you just move on 
EDwsd306:6	S6:	 yeah of course 
EDwsd306:7	S7:	 okay erm the worst scenario we the worst scenario we chose er was the first one what we had 
EDwsd306:8	SX:	 @@
EDwsd306:9	S7:	 erm i will really appreciate if if respect is shown when i talk because i'm tired and you are tired and we have had lunch and i mean it's really annoying so thank you erm i- it's worst because er we are going to lose our cultures erm and that's means that we are going to lose our diversity and our identity because identity is a parture erm of our culture erm and it's most unlikely that er people will accept that it's only english which is spoken and er that we are a unity er in every x erm it will be hard to deal with a political system and to make decisions
EDwsd306:10	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:11	S7:	 er and a question which is risen is er where should the border be 
EDwsd306:12	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:13	S7:	 for the unity er so our suggestions er for preventing this to happen er is to keep er the er na- er the national and religi- erm no er region languages erm to teach erm to learn this er languages and to develop them erm and that's how we're going to hold on o- er er to our culture 
EDwsd306:14	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:15	S7:	 erm but languages er will change it will be influence erm from english or other languages er but we should be aware erm that we have the same e- er expressions er in our mother tongue 
EDwsd306:16	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:17	S7:	 and this is how we're going to keep our culture and c- er customs erm 
EDwsd306:18	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:19	S7:	 and our proposal is that the budget erm should be so that er we should spend more money er on culture issues 
EDwsd306:20	S6:	 okay so what's your then your most likely and your best case 
EDwsd306:21	S7:	 erm 
EDwsd306:22	S7:	 most likely is er number two
EDwsd306:23	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:24	S7:	 and erm this is because er we english is kind of the erm the language number one when it comes to research publication erm which language we're actually speaking today er at the seminar erm but we think that it's not going to be that scenario in in some years
EDwsd306:25	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:26	S7:	 er so we recommend that to go to number three
EDwsd306:27	S6:	 okay that's the this is your best case
EDwsd306:28	S7:	 no er sorry number four 
EDwsd306:29	S6:	 that is your best case scenario okay 
EDwsd306:30	S7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:31	S7:	 so to go to number four erm we have to invest in er national languages
EDwsd306:32	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:33	S7:	 er we should break down borders but not borders like country borders but borders when it comes to economical life education it should be mobility erm and we should keep er the diversity in some areas as culture 
EDwsd306:34	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:35	S7:	 erm and we should invest in er education er of languages other cultures erm and at the same time the educational systems should be diversed because we want to preserve erm the diversity and not to learn the same thing at every university 
EDwsd306:36	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:37	S7:	 so in short terms that's what is that 
EDwsd306:38	S6:	 okay so actually you want to go from here to here 
EDwsd306:39	S7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:40	S6:	 okay okay is that clear for everyone everyone has anyone has questions for group number one no okay then i propose to er go to group number two who will give us a short 
EDwsd306:41	S8:	 okay er @ hh @ hh er we are er we're we're not in complete agreement @@ within the group so 
EDwsd306:42	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:43	SX:	 @
EDwsd306:44	S8:	 er yah so we er w- we had some problems agreeing er but what we agree on is that er scenario number one is the worst case
EDwsd306:45	S6:	 okay but that's nice then we already have two groups 
EDwsd306:46	S8:	 but then again the extreme 
EDwsd306:47	SS:	 @@@@@
EDwsd306:48	S8:	 of number three is also just as bad because that would be total chaos and nobody will understand each other 
EDwsd306:49	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:50	S8:	 erm so it's xx too @@ er it's it's xxx 
EDwsd306:51	S6:	 x x x x two worst case 
EDwsd306:52	S8:	 yeah because x x x x two extremes 
EDwsd306:53	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:54	S8:	 so 
EDwsd306:55	S6:	 perfect 
EDwsd306:56	S8:	 er and what we erm decided was the best for the majority at least er was the number four lego 
EDwsd306:57	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:58	S8:	 and most likely i don't know what we want 
EDwsd306:59	S14:	 we didn't agree i think 
EDwsd306:60	S8:	 no we really couldn't agree 
EDwsd306:61	S9:	 no we couldn't 
EDwsd306:62	S8:	 er 
EDwsd306:63	S9:	 we we kn- we know what we want 
EDwsd306:64	SX-f:	 hh 
EDwsd306:65	S8:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:66	S9:	 but we definitely didn't we kn- and and we know what we definitely don't want but it was so difficult to to 
EDwsd306:67	S6:	 but now we've heard the recommendations of 
EDwsd306:68	S12:	 but it must but it must be this one because there's not so much left 
EDwsd306:69	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:70	S6:	 yeah but it could be the same is more brief it's possible but now you've now you've heard the the recommendations of group number one 
EDwsd306:71	S12:	 yeah okay 
EDwsd306:72	S6:	 does it cha- makes it does it make it easier for example they say this is the most likely can you agree upon that do you thi- di- did you talk about this scenario as a possible 
EDwsd306:73	S8:	 yeah well what we only talked about was that we fear that it might be going in the direction of number one 
EDwsd306:74	S6:	 okay so you think this is actually the most likely 
EDwsd306:75	S8:	 yeah but but not the extreme 
EDwsd306:76	S9:	 this is the most wanted by some people 
EDwsd306:77	S8:	 but the er w- s- see kind of a trend that it's it's it it's becoming more homogen- -eous you know 
EDwsd306:78	S6:	 maybe in between xx 
EDwsd306:79	S6:	 maybe a little bit in between these two
EDwsd306:80	S8:	 yes 
EDwsd306:81	S6:	 okay then i write it here in the middle 
EDwsd306:82	S8:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:83	S6:	 somewhere er between this one and this one 
EDwsd306:84	S9:	 actually 
EDwsd306:85	S9:	 more to the left 
EDwsd306:86	S6:	 more here 
EDwsd306:87	S9:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:88	S6:	 okay and this okay i write it down here okay
EDwsd306:89	S8:	 yah 
EDwsd306:90	S8:	 so our recommendation is to er er to make policies that counterweight that trend that it's pushing towards number one 
EDwsd306:91	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:92	S8:	 erm er for instan- wha- what did we talk about
EDwsd306:93	S14:	 unesco i think 
EDwsd306:94	S8:	 yeah so like institutions like unesco 
EDwsd306:95	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:96	S8:	 should have a more important role maybe er x x x x x x x x x very important people 
EDwsd306:97	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:98	S8:	 to secure er diversity and secure erm i- i- erm regional identity national identity cultures 
EDwsd306:99	SX-14:	 hm 
EDwsd306:100	S8:	 heritage 
EDwsd306:101	S6:	 okay so more influence or more 
EDwsd306:102	S8:	 and more focus and more awareness on minority rights er region- regional identity stuff like that 
EDwsd306:103	S8:	 also make sure that national languages are not being er not neglected so we don't we we we don't want english to be the only 
EDwsd306:104	S6:	 okay so stimulate x x 
EDwsd306:105	S8:	 yeah we'd like english to be a tool 
EDwsd306:106	SX:	 number three 
EDwsd306:107	S8:	 as x x x what we had today in one way but then again not lose focus on er national languages 
EDwsd306:108	S8:	 yeah there you are yeah i think that sums up 
EDwsd306:109	S6:	 yeah is that okay for you okay sorry group one i forgot to write down your recommendation i was too busy in this corner could you repeat the most important ones
EDwsd306:110	S7:	 er just a second erm to invest in er national and re- er regional languages 
EDwsd306:111	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:112	S7:	 er break down borders but keep keeping the erm diversity 
EDwsd306:113	SX-f:	 actually i have a question 
EDwsd306:114	S7:	 and invest in education and culture 
EDwsd306:115	S6:	 erm 
EDwsd306:116	S6:	 okay but do you also have then erm some concrete example on how they should invest in education what should they provide or 
EDwsd306:117	S7:	 erm er i think we stick with the three languages where is my group yeah 
EDwsd306:118	SX:	 x 
EDwsd306:119	S7:	 didn't we stick with three languages as they proposed in lego erm actually oh yes we had those erm 
EDwsd306:120	SX-10:	 we had the categories 
EDwsd306:121	S7:	 yeah we have th- oh yeah i forgot to say that we had categories erm somewhere yeah that erm we should have categories of languages so every s- every er pupil er could erm choose between er nordic western eastern and southern european 
EDwsd306:122	S6:	 okay so 
EDwsd306:123	S11:	 so that even if like english or nobody has like just one common language like english as is at the moment that when they travel from two different parts of europe they are going to find someone who speaks a language from that category so 
EDwsd306:124	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:125	S11:	 they're going to be on equal 
EDwsd306:126	SX-7:	 okay 
EDwsd306:127	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:128	S11:	 amount of language use 
EDwsd306:129	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:130	SX-10:	 so they should learn one language from each category 
EDwsd306:131	S7:	 hm 
EDwsd306:132	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:133	SX:	 hm 
EDwsd306:134	S7:	 hm 
EDwsd306:135	S6:	 x you made categories of languages 
EDwsd306:136	SS:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:137	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:138	S7:	 and it's kind of dividing europe in four 
EDwsd306:139	S6:	 okay
EDwsd306:140	S7:	 erm but if there are some bad things with that erm erm because it's not always that you can find a common language with someone but yeah 
EDwsd306:141	S12:	 we can't just talk about that @
EDwsd306:142	S7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:143	S6:	 okay number two you want anything to add
EDwsd306:144	S9:	 you just asked about questions to number one and now actually i would have one 
EDwsd306:145	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:146	S9:	 which is because you said break down borders but erm keeping diversity do you mean erm that the maybe this is taking you too far break er that the nation state is going to dimin- be extinguished
EDwsd306:147	SX-m:	 the actual borders
EDwsd306:148	S9:	 yeah c- 
EDwsd306:149	S7:	 bord- er border could be like taxes i mean we've 
EDwsd306:150	S9:	 ah 
EDwsd306:151	S7:	 we are going to have mobility then it should be easier for you to 
EDwsd306:152	S9:	 okay 
EDwsd306:153	S7:	 to do business in france as it t- er s- as easy as in germany 
EDwsd306:154	S9:	 hm 
EDwsd306:155	S6:	 in order to increase mobility okay 
EDwsd306:156	S7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:157	S6:	 yeah yeah okay erm then group number two if you have anything to add now that you've heard the full @@ recommendation of number one 
EDwsd306:158	SX-f:	 group two 
EDwsd306:159	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:160	SX-9:	 xx 
EDwsd306:161	S14:	 actually we didn't go t- so far to so how to agree on this 
EDwsd306:162	SX-9:	 no 
EDwsd306:163	S14:	 i think we mentioned something about er erm preserving the nat- native language at school at the school so that it's not only in english 
EDwsd306:164	S6:	 okay but that could be because that's quite a concrete 
EDwsd306:165	S14:	 for example 
EDwsd306:166	S14:	 yes 
EDwsd306:167	SX:	 hm 
EDwsd306:168	S6:	 measure to take so preserve at under two preserving national languages in school that's a very concrete 
EDwsd306:169	S9:	 or regional languages definitely just just just native languages because it's it's 
EDwsd306:170	S14:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:171	S14:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:172	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:173	S9:	 cos erm i mean a language which isn't spoken is going to die 
EDwsd306:174	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:175	S9:	 for sooner or later 
EDwsd306:176	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:177	S12:	 we had primary school level secondary school level or just general school level 
EDwsd306:178	S9:	 prese- from the first day on huh 
EDwsd306:179	S14:	 er 
EDwsd306:180	S14:	 yeah fo- erm from the first grade 
EDwsd306:181	S9:	 kindergarten 
EDwsd306:182	S8:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:183	S9:	 if it's possible 
EDwsd306:184	S6:	 okay anybody has got a question for group number two anything to add no group number three okay that's you 
EDwsd306:185	S15:	 so er we had no differences in opinion as far as the worst case is concerned that it's again 
EDwsd306:186	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:187	S15:	 er the first scenario
EDwsd306:188	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:189	S15:	 and i'm not going to repeat the arguments for that because i think that [S7] made it quite clear
EDwsd306:190	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:191	S15:	 and we had so- some problems deciding which is the best and the most probable but finally we came out er with the decision that numb- er scenario number four is the best case and also the most like- likely 
EDwsd306:192	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:193	S15:	 er 
EDwsd306:194	S6:	 number four 
EDwsd306:195	S15:	 number four and er just that er we 
EDwsd306:196	S12:	 x x 
EDwsd306:197	S15:	 want to place our solution som- somewhere nearer to multilinguism than to unity 
EDwsd306:198	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:199	S15:	 maybe in the right corner hm 
EDwsd306:200	S6:	 okay okay so it's more a little bit more in the direction of multilingualism than 
EDwsd306:201	S15:	 yah 
EDwsd306:202	S6:	 to direction of unity okay 
EDwsd306:203	S15:	 and that's because we think that europe is erm getting more and more united and this a good tendency and er our recommendations are to stimulate unity in all fields but culture because er 
EDwsd306:204	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:205	S15:	 we should realize and we should appreciate that language a language is not only a tool a language means culture and everything that erm erm er it's not only a tool for communication but it has er it er has our history our traditions er er the connotations which each language er 
EDwsd306:206	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:207	S15:	 er contains and so on so a language is a very complicated er body 
EDwsd306:208	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:209	S15:	 and a very complicated organism so er we 
EDwsd306:210	S12:	 so you say stimulate 
EDwsd306:211	S15:	 er stimulate unity in all fields but culture and we believe that in the future europe will be moving towards a common policy concerning defense foreign affairs economy agriculture external trade immigration role order 
EDwsd306:212	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:213	S15:	 and education but not culture now that er 
EDwsd306:214	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:215	S15:	 er unity and diversity only and only linguistic diversity and er we we think that in the future and which is a a good er tendency is that erm europe is moving towards federa- federalization and er europea- the european constitution is er maybe a large step in this direction 
EDwsd306:216	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:217	S15:	 but er we believe that er the european union should keep er its policy of er all languages are created equal i mean that every state that is accepted to the european union should have its er should ha- should have its languages an official language of the european union you know even malta which has two official languages english and maltese they er they decided to get the maltese as an official language of the e u 
EDwsd306:218	S6:	 mhm okay 
EDwsd306:219	S15:	 and although it might er this might create some bureaucratic diff- difficulties er we believe that it's very important to keep all languages in the e u and therefore we believe that er e u and the national states should promote er teaching english and at least two other foreign languages two other er european languages 
EDwsd306:220	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:221	S15:	 so that we have a tool to communicate but we have other languages who er which bear which bear the our cultures 
EDwsd306:222	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:223	S15:	 and we sh- we also believe that er more opportunities for studying er lesser used languages should be created 
EDwsd306:224	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:225	S6:	 okay so actually you think if i'm right that the educational system should become more er united like we have the same system 
EDwsd306:226	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:227	S15:	 yah 
EDwsd306:228	S15:	 yah 
EDwsd306:229	S6:	 and you have to stimulate in the whole education system in the whole of europe to study english and 
EDwsd306:230	SX-15:	 yah 
EDwsd306:231	S6:	 two other languages 
EDwsd306:232	S15:	 two other 
EDwsd306:233	S15:	 at least 
EDwsd306:234	S6:	 at least okay so that should be 
EDwsd306:235	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:236	S15:	 and in good and in- introduce lesser used languages 
EDwsd306:237	S6:	 the policy in the whole of e u 
EDwsd306:238	S6:	 okay also reintroduce them 
EDwsd306:239	S15:	 yah and we think that the x x xxxxx would be good 
EDwsd306:240	S6:	 okay okay 
EDwsd306:241	SX-6:	 we only have er the edu- educational system 
EDwsd306:242	S12:	 okay yes 
EDwsd306:243	S15:	 yeah and lesser lesser used languages 
EDwsd306:244	S6:	 yeah and stimulation or reintroduction of lesser used 
EDwsd306:245	SX-15:	 i think that's it 
EDwsd306:246	S6:	 okay does anybody have a question for group number three anything unclear anybody anything to add
EDwsd306:247	SX:	 @
EDwsd306:248	S6:	 no then erm group number four who will say something 
EDwsd306:249	S1:	 what definitely unites us in this diverse group is the conviction that unity er that scenario one is the worst case scenario 
EDwsd306:250	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:251	SX-f:	 @@
EDwsd306:252	S6:	 oh that's good to know then we already have something

EDwsd306:255	S6:	 okay
EDwsd306:256	S1:	 what we also seem to have in common almost is that we think that the best scenario is number four 
EDwsd306:257	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:258	S1:	 we think so because we think that it is on the one hand the most democratic because all the national languages and regional languages are enfostered it is erm it gives the freedom to choose a language which is er in contrast to scenario three where you have to learn thirty languages or whatever and you have to it seemed at least and it also shows a respect for the other languages which is very important for us and erm also the idea that everybody has access to the languages
EDwsd306:259	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:260	S1:	 erm we als- we also think that is the most likely one we do not think that the direction goes into english-only because national languages and the national roots in europe are ways too important for that and er we think that there's a general opinion shared in europe 
EDwsd306:261	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:262	S1:	 all right 
EDwsd306:263	S12:	 yeah got that 
EDwsd306:264	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:265	S1:	 yah we started discussing on the er discussing the recommendations 
EDwsd306:266	S6:	 and 
EDwsd306:267	S1:	 erm first of all we think that erm the learning of er languages should be financially promoted we also discussed free access i hope that is correct me if if i'm wrong here free access to learning all the languages which means national languages regional languages and lesser used languages depending on the area you come from it if it if it is 
EDwsd306:268	S12:	 can we xx merge those two recommendations and financial support for free access or is that s- 
EDwsd306:269	S1:	 yeah i will probably we should even go so far as to say free access to 
EDwsd306:270	SX-4:	 it's one 
EDwsd306:271	S12:	 hm 
EDwsd306:272	S1:	 the learning of language or didn't we agree or let's keep it to financial support 
EDwsd306:273	S4:	 there is kind of concern about like that is now a process that just seem xx x elite of the society for we would like kind of that everybody could actually have the opportunity 
EDwsd306:274	S1:	 of 
EDwsd306:275	S4:	 to study and not just er 
EDwsd306:276	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:277	S4:	 a small elite because at the moment er what we think it is that there's just this this small group on university level actually have access but if er

EDwsd306:279	S4:	 to be like say it's primary school x x x even the working class are x x x 
EDwsd306:280	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:281	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:282	S4:	 so that's for some xx 
EDwsd306:283	S1:	 therefore we thought free access because everybody really everybody 
EDwsd306:284	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:285	S1:	 should get access to it 
EDwsd306:286	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:287	S1:	 and not because you don't have enough money you can't do the language course 
EDwsd306:288	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:289	S6:	 but that's er that's a good point so everybody in europe should have free access 
EDwsd306:290	S1:	 everybody in europe 
EDwsd306:291	S1:	 no matter from which social class and where from 
EDwsd306:292	S6:	 okay exactly also to to make it more equal 
EDwsd306:293	S1:	 to make it equal exactly 
EDwsd306:294	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:295	S4:	 and we stress like that everybody has to have the choice like it's not something that you have necessarily to do 
EDwsd306:296	S6:	 okay it's a choice 
EDwsd306:297	SX-14:	 free access 
EDwsd306:298	S4:	 you just er if you feel like 
EDwsd306:299	S1:	 and that it should not only be the most the the common languages but also the regional languages and lesser used languages
EDwsd306:300	S6:	 okay but one question if she s- she said it's a choice but how will you make 
EDwsd306:301	S1:	 propo- erm erm sorry d- can i re- restate that 
EDwsd306:302	S6:	 yeah sure sorry 
EDwsd306:303	S1:	 free access to those so er government should promote those as well so that they have a choice what to take 
EDwsd306:304	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:305	S1:	 we do not we are not in favor of the idea that we say you have to learn that because you live there 
EDwsd306:306	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:307	S1:	 no but the go- it should be consciously done that also lesser used languages and 
EDwsd306:308	S6:	 but 
EDwsd306:309	S1:	 that pr- that language teachers are provided for examples 
EDwsd306:310	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:311	S1:	 for lesser used languages because often they are not
EDwsd306:312	S6:	 okay so providing more teachers for lesser used languages for example and material for example 
EDwsd306:313	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:314	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:315	S4:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:316	S1:	 yeah exactly 
EDwsd306:317	S6:	 okay that could be xx 
EDwsd306:318	S1:	 so that the free access should really include everything
EDwsd306:319	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:320	S1:	 but i think that's all right if i mean if you know what 
EDwsd306:321	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:322	S6:	 yeah but that might be a good concrete example 
EDwsd306:323	S1:	 okay okay 
EDwsd306:324	S6:	 which you could use maybe 
EDwsd306:325	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:326	S6:	 that makes it really like the e u should train teachers of lesser used languages so there's more access to them for example 
EDwsd306:327	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah 
EDwsd306:328	S1:	 for example example in austria i live in austria i c- i live close to vienna which is close to hungary as well but it's hardly possible to get hungarian lessons cos no teachers are there they are not provided things like that
EDwsd306:329	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:330	S6:	 okay good example 
EDwsd306:331	SX-9:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:332	S1:	 then er what we think is that erm the spread of european cultures and languages should be supported through media for example so that erm for example again from my point of view living in austria i should get access to spanish media i should get access to media in different languages so that the interest in other languages is enfostered so that there is so that the need to learn other languages is felt actually by people 
EDwsd306:333	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:334	S6:	 okay but do you think then that the e u should influence those media or only make it possible 
EDwsd306:335	S1:	 make it possible 
EDwsd306:336	S6:	 make it accessible in every country 
EDwsd306:337	SX-f:	 but 
EDwsd306:338	S1:	 exact- for example in the internet that one supports i guess the problem is that it all somehow goes over finance support er also er pages which are not written in english but in all the other languages
EDwsd306:339	S4:	 well we were talking earlier cos like er at that moment in develop like the israel we just get one point of view 
EDwsd306:340	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:341	S4:	 when we the watch the news or anything 
EDwsd306:342	S6:	 yah 
EDwsd306:343	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:344	S4:	 and we would like give you that more languages involved obviously you can get different point of view and not just er 
EDwsd306:345	SX-6:	 hm 
EDwsd306:346	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:347	S4:	 united kingdom and the states and because that's what's going on now 
EDwsd306:348	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:349	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:350	S4:	 so like just er if we have access like from even eastern european country like the 
EDwsd306:351	SX-6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:352	S4:	 they have a different history so they can x us 
EDwsd306:353	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:354	S6:	 and from that you also create more interest 
EDwsd306:355	S4:	 yeah but yeah 
EDwsd306:356	S4:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:357	S1:	 exactly these two things that more 
EDwsd306:358	S6:	 in different languages 
EDwsd306:359	S4:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:360	S4:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:361	S1:	 the ten- the er a broader perspective and the interest in all the languages and other cultures 
EDwsd306:362	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:363	S1:	 what we thought as well of please correct me if i'm wrong is that we think that awareness should be raised about the status of english as a lingua franca that it is different from english as a native language and that we thought about as we presented in our scenario that english should really be taught as a lingua franca that means one limits the num- the number of years english is taught in in in s- in compulsory school it's not nine years it is for example in austria or in other countries but it's only like four years and you learn only the essential you learn english as a lingua franca and then you can choose other languages if you want to 
EDwsd306:364	SX-f:	 and also english 
EDwsd306:365	S1:	 exactly if you want to you choose english as a native language as one of the options that's then an option next to french next to catalanian next to latvian so english is really only taught as a lingua franca and reduced in the number of years it is taught
EDwsd306:366	S6:	 okay so it should only be obligatory for a few years
EDwsd306:367	S1:	 yeah exactly and only the essentials for using it as it sai- was said before as a tool 
EDwsd306:368	S6:	 as a tool okay 
EDwsd306:369	S1:	 if one wants to get more then afterwards as a native language
EDwsd306:370	S6:	 okay afterwards it's a free choice 
EDwsd306:371	S1:	 exactly 
EDwsd306:372	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:373	S1:	 and that of course includes also now the support of of er research into teaching materials in pedagogic ways of how to teach a lingua franca 
EDwsd306:374	S6:	 okay so more researches on lingua franca and teaching methods 
EDwsd306:375	S1:	 exactly 
EDwsd306:376	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:377	S1:	 because we talked about the the english language books we had in our english classes and we er c- we agreed that it's mainly that they mainly deal with the common mister and missis brown stories and middle class family home and there is the page on on the sights of london and you learn about new york and that should not be included any more it should be the cultures of all the european countries somehow included and a different approach to teaching therefore we need different teaching methods as well 
EDwsd306:378	S6:	 okay but 
EDwsd306:379	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:380	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:381	S6:	 okay but that might be a content of reach- er of research or research outcome 
EDwsd306:382	S1:	 yeah because by now these materials do not exist 
EDwsd306:383	S6:	 but your okay but your main point is there should be more support and more finance and more possibilities to do research on 
EDwsd306:384	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:385	S6:	 lingua franca and erm 
EDwsd306:386	S1:	 and the pedagogic ways of 
EDwsd306:387	S6:	 and the pedagogic ways okay yeah
EDwsd306:388	S12:	 er w- w- well the summary i hh that you are giving it's a bit different from what i had in mind i i thought that you were also saying that you xx distinguish between basic english or euro english as a lingua franca and 
EDwsd306:389	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:390	S6:	 aha 
EDwsd306:391	S12:	 er advanced english and xxx xx x x x x x you could choose for other languages 
EDwsd306:392	S1:	 i wouldn't 
EDwsd306:393	S6:	 that was the point 
EDwsd306:394	S1:	 i would personally 
EDwsd306:395	S1:	 yeah but i would personally not use the terms basic and advanced because that makes a connotation which is not in favor of the of the com- of the idea i think 
EDwsd306:396	S12:	 okay how would you er 
EDwsd306:397	S6:	 but they thought the formal one 
EDwsd306:398	S1:	 i think 
EDwsd306:399	S1:	 i should i think we should stick to the linguistic terms which are lingua franca and native language
EDwsd306:400	S16:	 traditional language and english as a lingua franca 
EDwsd306:401	SX-8:	 native er native 
EDwsd306:402	S15:	 okay just english as a lingua franca and english as a native 
EDwsd306:403	S1:	 these are correct terms 
EDwsd306:404	S1:	 let's say if you're yeah 
EDwsd306:405	S12:	 ah okay 
EDwsd306:406	S12:	 yeah it it it just makes it longer it's all so 
EDwsd306:407	SX-f:	 british 
EDwsd306:408	S2:	 no but it's important distinction 
EDwsd306:409	S1:	 it's about political correctness in that as well so because basic is like er i mean we know what it means but it could be misunderstood 
EDwsd306:410	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:411	S6:	 and the other thing i was er summarizing was er another point for the support of the research 
EDwsd306:412	S1:	 mhm mhm 
EDwsd306:413	S6:	 so that's the next point 
EDwsd306:414	S12:	 yeah that was er investing in research on 
EDwsd306:415	S6:	 research on lingua franca and erm pedagogic 
EDwsd306:416	S12:	 yah so but this er just to finish off this one i would xxxxxxxx so distinguish between english as a lingua franca and 
EDwsd306:417	SX-f:	 y- yeah er er 
EDwsd306:418	S1:	 and english as a native language 
EDwsd306:419	S12:	 ah okay 
EDwsd306:420	S17:	 i just have a comment on that because in germany we do have erm books and materials for children which include europe either for spanish erm or english xx 
EDwsd306:421	S1:	 okay 
EDwsd306:422	S17:	 so there don't have to be researches erm because they don't exist they do exist maybe they can be more 
EDwsd306:423	S1:	 but that er isn't that only the the culture i mean the the 
EDwsd306:424	S17:	 wide 
EDwsd306:425	S1:	 the c- the content of the the chapters so to say that that you that you talk about i don't know examining your books as well it's about er 
EDwsd306:426	S17:	 no you er talk about eur- europe 
EDwsd306:427	S1:	 exactly but what we w- wa- w- want to say as well is that how to teach a lingua franca what is essential to teach them con- concerning only the language apart from the erm like the content you teach them do you understand what i mean no @@
EDwsd306:428	S17:	 but i thought you said er books should include something like europe er this that exist 
EDwsd306:429	S1:	 yeah yeah but on- but also about how to teach a lingua franca that's the second point somehow 
EDwsd306:430	S17:	 mhm

EDwsd306:655	SS:	 x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x 
EDwsd306:656	S14:	 hey can i can i say something because i have a good example er i think it's really useful that people pay for the t v because the 
EDwsd306:657	S6:	 sorry 
EDwsd306:658	S6:	 yah 
EDwsd306:659	S14:	 this er national t v is also for example in finland i think they are also paying for for example swedish er programs in the t v so like the commercial t v would never do it so i i would o- object that that you just er free the whole t v because then it must be really like erm 
EDwsd306:660	S11:	 maybe there should be like a minimal payment 
EDwsd306:661	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:662	S11:	 not like a hundred pounds or something like that 
EDwsd306:663	S14:	 help the americani- americanization 
EDwsd306:664	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:665	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:666	S9:	 no no no wait wait wait wait a minute free free access is something completely different 
EDwsd306:667	S6:	 but what wh- what would you sa- sorry 
EDwsd306:668	S14:	 but you would l- you refer to this that you have to pay so much but i think i- it's just the taxes you know you they use for 
EDwsd306:669	S6:	 sorry 
EDwsd306:670	S14:	 making different programs 
EDwsd306:671	S6:	 but can you then make 
EDwsd306:672	SX-9:	 no it's not 
EDwsd306:673	S6:	 can you then adjust the recommendations so you can agree upon it can you 
EDwsd306:674	S14:	 yes 
EDwsd306:675	S6:	 maybe restate it 
EDwsd306:676	S14:	 i mean i wouldn't say that we just er take this er this fee away but er erm 
EDwsd306:677	S6:	 but would you could could we say then no not free access but in- increasing accessibility
EDwsd306:678	S14:	 i mean er for for example that er that it's erm 
EDwsd306:679	S6:	 of cheap media 
EDwsd306:680	S14:	 i think it's even not even possible in some parts of europe to get er some er you know 
EDwsd306:681	S6:	 no but that can be solved when everything is 
EDwsd306:682	S14:	 progress on the other yes 
EDwsd306:683	S9:	 here you go this is 
EDwsd306:684	S14:	 yes well that's i think what you are also up to 
EDwsd306:685	S9:	 this is my recommendation my recommendation is 
EDwsd306:686	S6:	 please one at a time please 
EDwsd306:687	S14:	 yes 
EDwsd306:688	S9:	 my recommendation is free access 
EDwsd306:689	S14:	 yes so i think also that you mean that 
EDwsd306:690	S9:	 x x x x europe 
EDwsd306:691	S9:	 yes 
EDwsd306:692	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:693	S9:	 i don't i i don't want any any any restrictions on that i want 
EDwsd306:694	S6:	 okay

EDwsd306:702	S6:	 that's okay yes [S15] 
EDwsd306:703	S15:	 do you think that do you think that we can make it easier and more attainable if we decided each to promote free access and should er facilitate free access only to the national media i mean the national television the national radio and for example one newspaper because it will be really difficult to convince all media to 
EDwsd306:704	S6:	 so no commercial media but at least public media

EDwsd306:774	SX-17:	 i have one question to free access i i wonder how we how we want to preserve the quality of media if it's only for free and er should there be one european newspaper which is for free because we can't we can't sell all newspaper for free 
EDwsd306:775	S6:	 no but 
EDwsd306:776	SX-17:	 it doesn't work 
EDwsd306:777	S6:	 i i don't think it's for free but for example that you could subsidize it it's it's it's how the e u will do it that's not for us to discuss but it's an aim we want to reach 
EDwsd306:778	S14:	 well can i say something 
EDwsd306:779	S6:	 yeah of course 
EDwsd306:780	S14:	 cos i thought i was a little misunderstood and s- two people there cos er i just explained to [S1] what i meant that i think that's the problem with this procedure that you really don't you just er give some kind of really wide er kind of aim but i for example with this i saw i instantly saw th- the backside of it 
EDwsd306:781	S6:	 aha 
EDwsd306:782	S14:	 so you i don't i don't know it's hard to make kind of broad suggestions without knowing which way you actually are going to go so that's i i i could recommend i could like erm er be happy with er er this your er suggestion that you just er subsidize erm 
EDwsd306:783	S6:	 mhm okay

EDwsd306:786	S14:	 so 
EDwsd306:787	S6:	 but i thin- i think that's the content of how they will 
EDwsd306:788	S14:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:789	S1:	 or probably if we just say promote accessibility 
EDwsd306:790	S14:	 yeah but er 
EDwsd306:791	S14:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:792	S1:	 is that then all right for you

EDwsd306:840	S2:	 yes

EDwsd306:843	S14:	 er teaching three languages or at least three languages we've like agree about this erm language policies at schools

EDwsd306:880	S19:	 er one thing maybe we can 
EDwsd306:881	S6:	 yes

EDwsd306:896	SX-9:	 institution 
EDwsd306:897	S19:	 institution in europe

EDwsd306:899	S15:	 yeah and it's great 
EDwsd306:900	S4:	 create a unity 
EDwsd306:901	S6:	 but does everybody agree upon this

EDwsd306:903	S11:	 can i add something to that last one 
EDwsd306:904	SX-f:	 i mean 
EDwsd306:905	S6:	 sorry yeah 
EDwsd306:906	S20:	 but there already exists the as far as i am concerned in graz there is the modern languages from council of europe and there is also the european language portfolio

EDwsd306:911	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:912	SX-7:	 but of course we don't know about it it's the problem 
EDwsd306:913	S20:	 you just have to apply 
EDwsd306:914	S20:	 because you know you you don't get it either from er y- your university or because you yourself 
EDwsd306:915	SX-7:	 er 
EDwsd306:916	S20:	 don't search so much i mean for everybody not for you 
EDwsd306:917	SX-7:	 mhm yeah yeah

EDwsd306:920	SX-20:	 so i mean i attended two of those already

EDwsd306:922	S6:	 yeah that's a good can you repeat it
EDwsd306:923	SX-7:	 er maybe that's why we should write on promoting on erm european culture or european languages but er institutional point just to

EDwsd306:966	S12:	 and you want to add something about the previous suggestion 
EDwsd306:967	S11:	 yeah i just wanted to add something quickly 
EDwsd306:968	S6:	 okay can we please keep it central yeah 
EDwsd306:969	S11:	 erm with the minimal requirement of three i was thinking if we can add the requirement for taking them from a specific 
EDwsd306:970	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:971	S11:	 area like what we said because languages go through status of fashion 
EDwsd306:972	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:973	S11:	 and at the moment everyone in london is learning spanish and what about the languages like in eastern europe 
EDwsd306:974	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:975	S11:	 so if we had a requirement to learn one from each kind the same 
EDwsd306:976	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:977	S11:	 so there'll always be some kind of common ground 
EDwsd306:978	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:979	S12:	 so one category
EDwsd306:980	S1:	 can 
EDwsd306:981	S12:	 eastern or slavic one from country 
EDwsd306:982	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:983	S11:	 yeah like slavic nordic germanic 
EDwsd306:984	S12:	 thing like that 
EDwsd306:985	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:986	S11:	 latin 
EDwsd306:987	S1:	 can i say something in connection to that i also asked myself when we specify that 
EDwsd306:988	S6:	 yes 
EDwsd306:989	S1:	 if we because it says there're english plus two other if we wanna have english as a lingua franca plus two other languages or if it should be any languages
EDwsd306:990	S15:	 yeah
EDwsd306:991	S1:	 or did do we wanna have everybody every every pupil should have english in school 
EDwsd306:992	S11:	 no i reckon it should just be any language 
EDwsd306:993	SX-f:	 yeah
EDwsd306:994	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:995	SX-7:	 this is democratic then
EDwsd306:996	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:997	SX-7:	 very democratic 
EDwsd306:998	S6:	 can everybody agree upon that
EDwsd306:999	S20:	 d- does any three languages
EDwsd306:1000	S6:	 yeah
EDwsd306:1001	SX-f:	 no 
EDwsd306:1002	S6:	 to learn any three languages
EDwsd306:1003	S11:	 minimum 
EDwsd306:1004	S6:	 minimum minimum it's the xx 
EDwsd306:1005	SX-12:	 a- any rule xx 
EDwsd306:1006	S20:	 but i i mean that we can't understand er er ev- every person i think it would be very useful to have one lingua franca but 
EDwsd306:1007	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1008	S20:	 even i mean even if even a lingua franca can change at the moment it's english but i mean in in in couple of years it could be spanish or or whatever language
EDwsd306:1009	SX-m:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1010	SX-19:	 xxxxxx 
EDwsd306:1011	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1012	S20:	 i mean there is a there is a very er big community on spanish speaking persons
EDwsd306:1013	SX-2:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1014	S20:	 but i there should be at least one lingua franca then we can understand other person i mean if everyone chooses three different languages we are 
EDwsd306:1015	SX-f:	 yah 
EDwsd306:1016	S15:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1017	S20:	 we won't er we won't 
EDwsd306:1018	S6:	 so then we should restate it in 
EDwsd306:1019	S20:	 understand 
EDwsd306:1020	S6:	 three languages one lingua franca 
EDwsd306:1021	SX-m:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1022	S6:	 plus two additional ones
EDwsd306:1023	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1024	S20:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1025	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1026	S6:	 that's fine
EDwsd306:1027	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1028	SX-15:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1029	S20:	 i mean that's that's what in in in in in march in barcelona was said in march two thousand two 
EDwsd306:1030	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1031	S20:	 that that this is like the the it was recommended like mother tongue plus two two foreign languages 
EDwsd306:1032	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1033	S20:	 that's the that's the great aim they had 
EDwsd306:1034	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1035	S11:	 they'll still be taken from different categories though
EDwsd306:1036	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1037	S11:	 because if for instance in england even everyone might just choose french and german then what about the rest of the languages everyone's gonna just be speaking french and german 
EDwsd306:1038	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1039	SX-7:	 english and then we 
EDwsd306:1040	S1:	 but that's again the question then of of the freedom of choice 
EDwsd306:1041	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1042	S1:	 do you wanna say you have to take a language from here from here from here from here 
EDwsd306:1043	S11:	 yeah but then there's loads of languages in that category that 
EDwsd306:1044	SX-20:	 the economic er factor will play xx 
EDwsd306:1045	SX-m:	 no it doesn't divide the languages into categories it just xxxxx 
EDwsd306:1046	SX-10:	 it's gonna be english 
EDwsd306:1047	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1048	S15:	 there isn't xxxxxx 
EDwsd306:1049	SX-f:	 but there can be various private reasons like my friends come from italy 
EDwsd306:1050	S1:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1051	SX-f:	 or my mother's cousin comes from italy or something like that because today there are such various xx 
EDwsd306:1052	S14:	 yeah i think it's hard to impose this 
EDwsd306:1053	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1054	S14:	 kind of rule on the people cos they have really 
EDwsd306:1055	S6:	 anybody would like to add something to this you you still want in the system with the divisions of regions right
EDwsd306:1056	S14:	 motivation for example 
EDwsd306:1057	S11:	 i would like because it'd give like everyone an option like in london like in england we h- we could be learning latvian or something 
EDwsd306:1058	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1059	S11:	 and i- i- some requirement to learn a language from one of these or 
EDwsd306:1060	S6:	 so sorry 
EDwsd306:1061	S11:	 you know what i mean so that there is some diversity because in in u K we just generally seem to go for french german spanish
EDwsd306:1062	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1063	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1064	S11:	 and that's it but what about the rest of the languages
EDwsd306:1065	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1066	S15:	 but er d- do you mean that s- 
EDwsd306:1067	S6:	 okay yes 
EDwsd306:1068	S6:	 sorry

EDwsd306:1070	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1071	S15:	 do you mean that er we should er learn english as lingua franca and choose two other languages from two different groups from two different categories
EDwsd306:1072	S11:	 well i don't really know i didn't really have any comment about a lingua franca i just forgot that completely and i was i wanted to be four languages so that we'd have one from each kind of 
EDwsd306:1073	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1074	S6:	 category 
EDwsd306:1075	S11:	 category 
EDwsd306:1076	S6:	 yeah okay 
EDwsd306:1077	S15:	 because but sometimes it's easier to learn two languages from one category because they're similar
EDwsd306:1078	SX-f:	 x 
EDwsd306:1079	S11:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1080	S15:	 and it would be difficult to learn a different maybe 
EDwsd306:1081	S6:	 but but maybe that's the reason why she wants to stimulate it

EDwsd306:1241	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1242	S7:	 saying like one or two more languages that that is a problem it's 
EDwsd306:1243	SX-6:	 yeah

EDwsd306:1245	S15:	 yeah
EDwsd306:1246	S7:	 we should do i mean if we're going to dic-

EDwsd306:1259	S6:	 even if in the

EDwsd306:1266	S7:	 i mean it's n- it's not the problem 
EDwsd306:1267	S11:	 i think that's too little 
EDwsd306:1268	S20:	 but i mean but if you if you look at people 
EDwsd306:1269	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1270	S20:	 who er o- er like again if you look at people who don't er wh- who do- who don't have access to university they even i mean there are german who even speak 
EDwsd306:1271	S6:	 although it can but i think her suggestion is it can be an aim 
EDwsd306:1272	S7:	 yeah i mean 
EDwsd306:1273	S6:	 maybe you are not reaching it put the process to there you have to ha- reach high in order to get anything done
EDwsd306:1274	S20:	 that's why it wh- why we could put at least one one other language 
EDwsd306:1275	S7:	 a- and another thing is we're talking only about higher education no y- you actually you learn languages at primary school at secondary school i mean in in i- it's i think it's a bit s- 
EDwsd306:1276	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1277	S6:	 yeah exactly 
EDwsd306:1278	S6:	 that should also be the 
EDwsd306:1279	S7:	 yeah i mean in norway we have mother tongue two of them
EDwsd306:1280	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1281	S7:	 two mother tongue and then you have english as a pri- er first language and then you have french or german as a second language and you have russian italian and spanish as a third language
EDwsd306:1282	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1283	S7:	 it's not a problem
EDwsd306:1284	SX-f:	 yeah but also

EDwsd306:1289	S6:	 erm yeah 
EDwsd306:1290	S4:	 okay just wanna say that you come from norway and you have a kind of situation that i come from italy and i think that i can s- 
EDwsd306:1291	SX-7:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1292	S4:	 speak as well for spain er we're kind of close that we have such a strong culture and it's so difficult for us to learn another language as is like it's not so easy if you don't have the culture that er we doupt all the film all the programs are in italian and everything is absolutely italian one hundred per cent
EDwsd306:1293	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1294	S4:	 so it's not so easy to change completely a language xxxxxx 
EDwsd306:1295	SX:	
EDwsd306:1296	S4:	 you try that you have to learn three languages since they're six because ours kind of way we are living is a bit different so you have to change also the way people are thinking before 
EDwsd306:1297	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1298	S4:	 just to impose and saying oh you have to learn three languages i completely agree that we should speak whatever like five languages but it is a different process it is difficult to reach the kind of stage 
EDwsd306:1299	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1300	S4:	 you are coming like holland or all this country and they're very good at languages and i'm so impressed because everybody can speak english if you come to my town like nobody in my parents can speak a word of any other languages

EDwsd306:1308	S6:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1309	S2:	 i'd like to come back to that i- former two language i think i think there's a reason behind why we choose plus two other languages cos when we were discussing we had discussion of diversity and equality of the language as of great importance if you choose one language as a lingua franca like english and then you have only one other language the problem is that all languages you're gonna choose would be in a function in way if you have two languages to choose you have all the diversity you want because you can't take another functional language it could be german 
EDwsd306:1310	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1311	S2:	 russian or whatever which is a big important language in commercial way of of thinking but if you can choose two other one you'll have you have th- this yeah you have the time and you have the the space for for take a language which is not useful it's just nice to learn it which is 
EDwsd306:1312	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1313	S2:	 neither difficult nor whatever it's just nice 
EDwsd306:1314	S6:	 okay
EDwsd306:1315	SX-f:	 i ca- 
EDwsd306:1316	S6:	 that's all someone over there yeah [S19] 
EDwsd306:1317	S19:	 okay er i think when we're ta- er talking about three or four or five languages at school we are we are forgetting maybe that er er we one use mayb- maybe with er o- er one having the one had the- then c i maybe we are er forgetting er children or teenagers living in marginal districts i i th- i mean this people you will say oh you have to learn two or three four languages and then we'll say okay i have to learn four and will er work in a factory and i have to learn four languages no i will learn english i will have enough and i will work in my factory and i will when i will go abroad
EDwsd306:1318	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1319	S19:	 for vacations or whatever well talking english is enough completely and i don't want french and german finnish or russian i don't want more and that's the mentality er the this kind of mentality is because of motivation and 
EDwsd306:1320	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1321	S19:	 we d- we can't say it we are going to i- in europe in this europe 
EDwsd306:1322	SX-6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1323	S19:	 and in the europe i i i got in mind in in fifty years we will have the same problem because i m- our society is not a problem as as fast as we think so if we want to learn to teach the children five or six languages okay but i think first we have to make something of this children
EDwsd306:1324	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1325	S15:	 but we have decided the scenario four is the best so we should aim for scenario four which is multilinguism 
EDwsd306:1326	S6:	 aha yes 
EDwsd306:1327	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1328	SX-f:	 but there's something they mind 
EDwsd306:1329	S6:	 good point 
EDwsd306:1330	S6:	 that's what we decided on 
EDwsd306:1331	SX-f:	 xxx

EDwsd306:1333	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1334	S19:	 xxxxxx 
EDwsd306:1335	S14:	 er well can i first reaction to that i think that they are in this thinking there's a problem that you decide when the child is like four years old if he or she is going to work in a rack- factory or somewhere else i mean i i also think that there should be a possibility for er for for erm learning languages and i think that is the problem of our discussion we have to decide if we impose languages if it's obligatory to 
EDwsd306:1336	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1337	S14:	 er to study these languages or do we speak more about opportunities and like enabling 
EDwsd306:1338	S6:	 facil- facilitating 
EDwsd306:1339	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1340	S14:	 er because i also think it's a lit- really a little problematic to demand that everybody has to er er because i think there there will be a motivation problem as

EDwsd306:1342	S14:	 erm something like that 
EDwsd306:1343	SS:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1344	S6:	 yes [S1] 
EDwsd306:1345	S1:	 i completely agree with her if we do n- if we just say that we disconnect our recommendation for compulsory school but say it is the aim for everyb- every european citizen to learn a lingua franca plus two other languages then i think 
EDwsd306:1346	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1347	S1:	 we could all agree on that 
EDwsd306:1348	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1349	S1:	 if it is the aim
EDwsd306:1350	S14:	 like make it a bit easier

EDwsd306:1359	S6:	 doesn't matter @
EDwsd306:1360	S11:	 if all european citizen has to learn a lingua franca and at the moment it seems like that the lingua franca is english so what do the native english people learn just one other language or can we have 
EDwsd306:1361	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1362	S11:	 t- we can we learn more 
EDwsd306:1363	S6:	 well if it's the aim like erm er [S1] just er er proposed then the aim is to learn as three or more languages so then for example english people in my opinion but i'm not sure maybe 
EDwsd306:1364	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1365	S6:	 i- it's for y- it's for you to decide of course then english people can learn an extra language if it's already the lingua franca because that's what i understood of [S1]'s point 
EDwsd306:1366	S11:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1367	S6:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1368	SX-22:	 but i'd like to say also that erm what you said er from spain yes erm i i think that the keyword about when we speak our languages is really the motivation

EDwsd306:1427	S6:	 motivation of multiple languages
EDwsd306:1428	SX-15:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1429	S11:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1430	S12:	 motivation to learn 
EDwsd306:1431	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1432	S15:	 yeah motivation to learn
EDwsd306:1433	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1434	S14:	 can i have some others i from personal experience i think er i've studied er four languages a- at school but some of them stayed a little like er 
EDwsd306:1435	S15:	 passive 
EDwsd306:1436	S14:	 passive or like because because we didn't really talk so i i would say that it's really important that that you learn to speak that it's 
EDwsd306:1437	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1438	S14:	 becomes more concrete
EDwsd306:1439	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1440	S14:	 and also i thought it was really good i- because in german we had some er natives er native er teachers who like came to our school and ga- gave some lessons so you really had to think what i can communicate with a 
EDwsd306:1441	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1442	S14:	 native speaker and it's not h- he or she is going to laugh at me or something like that and it's like working
EDwsd306:1443	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1444	S14:	 but this kind of really practical and er er kind of livi- living experience it's like the same with the camps 
EDwsd306:1445	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1446	S6:	 okay so more practical experience more exchange yes 
EDwsd306:1447	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1448	S2:	 i think the most important if you want installed languages at that age like s- six or yeah x even xxx 
EDwsd306:1449	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1450	S2:	 it's it's very important that that you that you accustom it to the to hear the language
EDwsd306:1451	S14:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1452	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1453	S11:	 by the media 
EDwsd306:1454	S2:	 yeah i think yeah i think grammar is right or to to learn grammar with a child at that age he can't write any neither his own language so it is quite stupid but if you you can see that in switzerland we've loads of children they they they grow up having two languages even 
EDwsd306:1455	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1456	S2:	 even if you had only heard for three years one language 
EDwsd306:1457	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1458	S2:	 neither had spoken it and you grow up you have languages afterwards you can speak it very easily 
EDwsd306:1459	S9:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1460	S2:	 and it's not matter that we have to put like in machines grammars and whatever but that we've got a product who work in business or whatever afterwards it is a matter of of openness and openness of ear and structured in your head 
EDwsd306:1461	SX-f:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1462	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd306:1463	S2:	 and overall which which which kind of permit you afterwards to easy do a language 
EDwsd306:1464	SX-6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1465	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1466	S2:	 but i think that should be an aim overall not to learn perfectly a language 
EDwsd306:1467	SS:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1468	S2:	 but as you say to be really concrete 
EDwsd306:1469	S22:	 to communicate this 
EDwsd306:1470	S2:	 let them play together mayb- cook together a different place x through things 
EDwsd306:1471	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1472	S2:	 put all xxx different things in a course like concrete uses having another language and things like that 
EDwsd306:1473	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1474	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1475	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1476	S6:	 so practical exchange
EDwsd306:1477	S2:	 yeah should be a game 
EDwsd306:1478	S6:	 of language 
EDwsd306:1479	S2:	 for the children 
EDwsd306:1480	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1481	SX-6:	 then practical with the exchange perhaps erm yes [S20] 
EDwsd306:1482	S20:	 erm there isn't a point on the flip chart which is invest in er language education i don't know if it could fit what i wanna say if it could fit there but i would also say that there should be some kind of common er curriculum er in process in the long run i don't know cos i i have attended the the thematic network projects on languages which was 
EDwsd306:1483	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1484	S20:	 erm co-funded by the council of europe on the language portfo- portfolio and was organized er from freie universitaet berlin and er that was a really good er thing they did it started with a universities of capitals of europe 
EDwsd306:1485	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1486	S20:	 but it didn't go further 
EDwsd306:1487	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1488	S20:	 i don't know why 
EDwsd306:1489	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1490	S20:	 and it focuses on having a common european curriculum er not only in the universities but also in the language institutions and language education in schools from the very very early level until the university level so i don't know how we could put it i mean it could be 
EDwsd306:1491	S6:	 yeah maybe it's also in youth 
EDwsd306:1492	S20:	 formulating a common 
EDwsd306:1493	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1494	S20:	 curriculum 
EDwsd306:1495	S6:	 i think it was also somewhere here erm unity in in the educational system in europe 
EDwsd306:1496	SX-15:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1497	S20:	 yes but erm erm erm i would i would i would er 
EDwsd306:1498	SX-f:	 in yeah but 
EDwsd306:1499	S6:	 i will come to you yeah
EDwsd306:1500	S20:	 i would focus on er national er 
EDwsd306:1501	S6:	 please let's keep it central yeah 
EDwsd306:1502	S20:	 i would focus on er national let's say adjustments according to the needs of each country
EDwsd306:1503	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1504	S20:	 but having a basic core and a rounded 
EDwsd306:1505	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1506	SX-20:	 xx 
EDwsd306:1507	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1508	S20:	 the national needs 
EDwsd306:1509	S6:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1510	S20:	 i don't know maybe there's an idea or 
EDwsd306:1511	S6:	 you wanted to add something
EDwsd306:1512	S7:	 yeah because we said what we said was erm 
EDwsd306:1513	SX:	
EDwsd306:1514	S7:	 to invest in education but to preserve the the diversity because what's the point to go to study abroad w- s- if i can learn the same thing in my country the thing is that it's more exciting to go to greece to see it while there er what they're er teaching or er studying in political science which i can't get it in oslo 
EDwsd306:1515	SX-f:	 xxx 
EDwsd306:1516	S6:	 okay yes 
EDwsd306:1517	SX-f:	 may i just yeah
EDwsd306:1518	S6:	 okay first [S20] and then you can 
EDwsd306:1519	SX-f:	 have a comment for that very short
EDwsd306:1520	S8:	 i i just xxxx 
EDwsd306:1521	S6:	 okay then she first and then you 
EDwsd306:1522	SX-f:	 yeah yeah 
EDwsd306:1523	S8:	 yeah then things you have like international baccelords already that is optional in norway now erm but maybe we could save that neither concrete as a concrete suggestion to er to create unity in the xxx center and then those you have nation varieties but then that but you have something silent 
EDwsd306:1524	S15:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1525	S8:	 but that is already present so it's erm hm i could be useful maybe to build on that as in but it have to be a clear recommendation so 
EDwsd306:1526	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1527	S8:	 to enhance or to encourage it i don't know 
EDwsd306:1528	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1529	S6:	 yeah yeah 
EDwsd306:1530	S20:	 erm what i want to say is that erm this er formulation of er curriculum hh er is not necessarily learning it in your own language because they have their let's say er xx which was er you have to spend six months er learning er er speaking or learning the language you already got from that network 
EDwsd306:1531	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1532	S20:	 in the country itself so anybody wishing to er let's say erm er i forgot the word in english though 
EDwsd306:1533	SX-m:	 @ @
EDwsd306:1534	S20:	 er improve the motivation or it's should be er supported from er er i don't know it should be having a be- better er 
EDwsd306:1535	SX-f:	 er 
EDwsd306:1536	S20:	 institution behind it it's not just appearing
EDwsd306:1537	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1538	S6:	 so more institutionalizing of the of the whole educational system
EDwsd306:1539	S20:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1540	S20:	 because somebody else pointed out before it's not so easy to decide it yourself you should have it already 
EDwsd306:1541	S6:	 exactly 
EDwsd306:1542	S20:	 erm 
EDwsd306:1543	S6:	 yeah it should be made more easy 
EDwsd306:1544	S20:	 in front of you and just pick it up 
EDwsd306:1545	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1546	S20:	 it's not so easy 
EDwsd306:1547	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1548	S6:	 okay so m- maybe more clearness about what possibilities are as well
EDwsd306:1549	S20:	 yes exactly yeah 
EDwsd306:1550	SX-6:	 okay more institutionalizing or more clearness for 
EDwsd306:1551	S12:	 more information inst- institutionalization x with 
EDwsd306:1552	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1553	S6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1554	SX-f:	 @@
EDwsd306:1555	S12:	 don't think exactly this is xx 
EDwsd306:1556	S6:	 and i i also want to write down the point over there erm 
EDwsd306:1557	S8:	 the international baccalaureate 
EDwsd306:1558	S6:	 yeah no it w- it was part of your point as well that erm erm there should be one core system in europe on the education like you said what it should yeah yeah 
EDwsd306:1559	S20:	 there is i- it there is it's just that it has to be improved 
EDwsd306:1560	S6:	 but it 
EDwsd306:1561	S6:	 but it should be improved the core system 
EDwsd306:1562	S20:	 yeah xxxxx 
EDwsd306:1563	S6:	 and then but it should also adjust to the national 
EDwsd306:1564	S20:	 standards and needs 
EDwsd306:1565	S6:	 standards 
EDwsd306:1566	SX-20:	 yes 
EDwsd306:1567	S6:	 okay
EDwsd306:1568	SX-f:	 shall we write that down as well
EDwsd306:1569	S15:	 yeah but that's not er 
EDwsd306:1570	S12:	 we should 
EDwsd306:1571	S15:	 under motivation 
EDwsd306:1572	S2:	 sorry sorry
EDwsd306:1573	SX-m:	 entschuldigung 
EDwsd306:1574	S15:	 that's not er under motivation right 
EDwsd306:1575	SX-m:	 could you 
EDwsd306:1576	S15:	 the core s- the core education the system is not under motivation
EDwsd306:1577	S6:	 ma- but motivation is the main aim isn't it
EDwsd306:1578	S15:	 yeah
EDwsd306:1579	S6:	 and this is something to provide or maybe can you please state it shortly so you can write it down
EDwsd306:1580	S20:	 yeah erm let's say enforcement or f- first of all it should be formulated before it's enforced er formulation and enforcement of erm erm you mean th- the exchange part i referred to before or the part of the 
EDwsd306:1581	S6:	 no 
EDwsd306:1582	S20:	 knowledge xx 
EDwsd306:1583	S6:	 th- the core no the core system education system with the national 
EDwsd306:1584	SX-f:	 core x xxx 
EDwsd306:1585	S20:	 okay yeah it's er formulating a common curriculum er on er language learning er from a very early er level at school until the university or even up to the university go further anyway 
EDwsd306:1586	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1587	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1588	S20:	 because you never stop learning a language itself 
EDwsd306:1589	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1590	S20:	 it's not like ge- going for diploma it's just learning 
EDwsd306:1591	SX-6:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1592	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1593	S15:	 like a lifetime job 
EDwsd306:1594	S20:	 actually a language 
EDwsd306:1595	SX-f:	 mhm
EDwsd306:1596	S6:	 okay final comments only if it's directly related to what she said
EDwsd306:1597	S20:	 haeh
EDwsd306:1598	S6:	 a lifetime job
EDwsd306:1599	S1:	 it's somehow connected to the language portf- european language portfolio you mentioned 
EDwsd306:1600	S20:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1601	S20:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1602	S1:	 i ju- i don't know a- a- a- are er are you familiar with the european with the european language portfolio
EDwsd306:1603	SX-f:	 oh yeah 
EDwsd306:1604	SX-f:	 no 
EDwsd306:1605	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1606	S1:	 no because wha- i what i would suggest in that when you talk about that as well is that what i think is that er hh the role of a lingua franca is not included in that and that would also be a recommendation that 
EDwsd306:1607	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1608	S1:	 the european council acknowledges that we use a lingua franca and that should be taken into the european language portfoli- 
EDwsd306:1609	S20:	 but er i i will give you an answer for that cos that that was a very strong debate nobody wanted to accept that there is a lingua franca of course 
EDwsd306:1610	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd306:1611	S20:	 all professors that attended it knew it already but er there is a strong debate now in the er parliament 
EDwsd306:1612	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1613	S20:	 because of the use of two official languages french and english and now they're upon deciding after the constitution about which language will be the only dominant language because of the expenses of the e u 
EDwsd306:1614	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1615	S20:	 er bodies you can't just have er twenty-seven thousand people working every six months there as x years spending so much paper so much er money on translators for two languages that's 
EDwsd306:1616	S6:	 okay 
EDwsd306:1617	S1:	 but 
EDwsd306:1618	S20:	 i mean it's a basic problem you can't just 
EDwsd306:1619	S6:	 okay i think it would be wise 
EDwsd306:1620	S20:	 that's why they don't say it's english and it's that 
EDwsd306:1621	S6:	 okay i think i think we have enough recommendations for the moment
EDwsd306:1622	S20:	 it's not just language 
EDwsd306:1623	S6:	 we will have a short break now to get some tea i will 
EDwsd306:1624	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd306:1625	S6:	 ask you kindly to be back in five to ten minutes so we can go on just take a coffee go outside for two minutes then come back
