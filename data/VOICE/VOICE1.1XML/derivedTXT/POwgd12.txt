POwgd12:1	S1:	 okay everybody erm 
POwgd12:2	S2:	 are you
POwgd12:3	S1:	 i've been volunteered for this erm job 
POwgd12:4	S2:	 okay 
POwgd12:5	S1:	 so we we're trying to do the best we can we have roughly one hour and ten minutes er to discuss this has everybody got the the document we're talking about and and [first name1] did mention 
POwgd12:6	S2:	 xxx 
POwgd12:7	S3:	 yes 
POwgd12:8	S1:	 that there were eight issues but in fact i see nine here under erm 
POwgd12:9	S2:	 ten actually 
POwgd12:10	S1:	 ten yes 
POwgd12:11	S4:	 ten 
POwgd12:12	S1:	 ten you're quite right organization of consortium so we have ten issues here and the first question is basically to look at them and see if we think there are any elements which are missing from those ten before we try and put them in order or discuss them individually hh erm so i wonder if anybody has any suggestions as to elements that might be missing from the administrative and organizational issues 
POwgd12:13	S5:	 yesterday we talked about marketing as well no on thursday 
POwgd12:14	S1:	 mhm
POwgd12:15	S5:	 we talked about marketing 
POwgd12:16	S4:	 marketing 
POwgd12:17	S5:	 aspects 
POwgd12:18	S1:	 promotional aspects 
POwgd12:19	S5:	 yeah promotional aspects xx i think 
POwgd12:20	S1:	 fr- yes from the administrative point of view 
POwgd12:21	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:22	S5:	 sure 
POwgd12:23	S5:	 and what it means to use and in order to promote the joint degrees 
POwgd12:24	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:25	S2:	 hh 
POwgd12:26	S6:	 can i 
POwgd12:27	S2:	 inside or outside otherwise it 
POwgd12:28	S5:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:29	S2:	 inside is for sometimes is very difficult to hh just to manage 
POwgd12:30	S1:	 mhm [S6] 
POwgd12:31	S6:	 can i ask what number seven is in terms 
POwgd12:32	S4:	 sorry 
POwgd12:33	S6:	 wha- wha- what kind of 
POwgd12:34	S1:	 yes who was there anybody here who 
POwgd12:35	S4:	 yeah erm i i i would like 
POwgd12:36	SS:	 semesters 
POwgd12:37	S1:	 terms so terms in the in the sense of s- academic terms er or semesters 
POwgd12:38	S7:	 when they start because they start you know in different countries 
POwgd12:39	S5:	 yeah er different xx that is different 
POwgd12:40	S6:	 it's academic actually 
POwgd12:41	S1:	 it's it seems to me that erm th- this is based on an assumption that the administrative erm issues just kick in when erm something is decided when it maybe that administrative issues also need to be looked at from you know the the preliminary discussion point of view 
POwgd12:42	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:43	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:44	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:45	S1:	 before a group organizes itself 
POwgd12:46	S3:	 because i think it's too late when everything has decided or even if the curricula hh curriculum has been decided it's just too late hh erm because i think we have quite different legal structures all over europe 
POwgd12:47	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:48	S3:	 as erm what i would like to ask you later is er how are you do- how you are doing this cooperation with the university of [place1] because er you have very different legal structures so 
POwgd12:49	S1:	 erm perhaps you could discuss that later erm 
POwgd12:50	S2:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:51	S1:	 but the wou- would anybody agree with me that perhaps we need to do we need to be er to put another erm element in here in terms of administrative input er in advance of er a grouping being organized 
POwgd12:52	S4:	 sure 
POwgd12:53	S5:	 so so as to give a basic guidelines and procedures 
POwgd12:54	S7:	 yes 
POwgd12:55	S1:	 well well sometimes i- it seems it seems to me not speaking as an administrative person here and i don't want to set up a conflict and [S6] you you can see things from both sides but perhaps sometimes erm academics will decide to do things and with- without erm er a a kind of a more pragmatic approach as as to whether things are are feasible or whether there are issues that need to be teased out before erm an academic is er decision is taken to proceed with organizing something would would you agree or not 
POwgd12:56	S6:	 erm i mean yes sometimes 
POwgd12:57	S1:	 @@
POwgd12:58	S4:	 hh 
POwgd12:59	S6:	 but erm erm there're just so many different possibilities and 
POwgd12:60	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:61	S6:	 models hh er er i i just personally i think the two things should go hand in hand 
POwgd12:62	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:63	S6:	 all the time 
POwgd12:64	S1:	 all the time yes yes
POwgd12:65	S6:	 and you shouldn't separate them often so and let's have the academic oh no let's bring the admin more let's have the admin
POwgd12:66	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:67	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:68	S1:	 yes i agree i i just so perhaps we could just put that as a 
POwgd12:69	S6:	 you have you have to allow x xx 
POwgd12:70	SX-f:	
POwgd12:71	S1:	 framework 
POwgd12:72	S6:	 framework that's fine 
POwgd12:73	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:74	S6:	 and useful but 
POwgd12:75	S8:	 they have the frameworks bottom-up xxx 
POwgd12:76	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:77	S8:	 but maybe just 
POwgd12:78	SX-f:	 x 
POwgd12:79	S8:	 yes but maybe that the you know the academic community knows that there is a framework in case i think i think that is xx our purpose you know to first to give a framework and so that they know they can come to us and 
POwgd12:80	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:81	S8:	 xx 
POwgd12:82	S5:	 the basic the basic er guidelines and the basic procedure 
POwgd12:83	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:84	S1:	 aha 
POwgd12:85	S8:	 yeah but it's it's not the basic er i'm i'm just talking now to disseminate the how to disseminate this 
POwgd12:86	S6:	 yeah but if if if you lead to this number seven that i structure the academic work 
POwgd12:87	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:88	S6:	 that th- that's an absolutely fundamental point and it can be completely obstructive to any successful sort of collaboration 
POwgd12:89	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:90	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:91	S6:	 because er not only from country to country from institution to institution the start from the end of the academic year varies and the 
POwgd12:92	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:93	S6:	 the apportioning of the bits of the year within that xx xxx and then 
POwgd12:94	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:95	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:96	S6:	 so and th- there isn't there isn't anything a network can do to control that 
POwgd12:97	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:98	S6:	 because it's it's governed to utterly other things 
POwgd12:99	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:100	S6:	 so your group that wants to do something has to find ways of overcoming the problems that are 
POwgd12:101	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:102	S6:	 i mean they are just our problems then 
POwgd12:103	S1:	 mhm erm going back to the initial question i i was asking that [first name1] suggested we asked each other or ask ourselves are there any elements here that are missing and we'd come up with one erm very clear thing which is the the promotional aspect the the marketing advertising and i i presume you mean in terms of equipment of of students to th- to a program 
POwgd12:104	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:105	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:106	S5:	 to make it known to 
POwgd12:107	S1:	 yeah and we've also mentioned the fact that right from the first there should be collaboration from the first steps there should be collaboration between the administrative side and the academic side and before we move on from that this question ar- ca- does anybody else believe that there are elements which are missing from the list we have in front of us 
POwgd12:108	S2:	 about the issues of the degree one piece of paper two piece of paper two coat of arms what kind of of erm diploma we gave we give will give to the students 
POwgd12:109	S1:	 yes that's that's actually very 
POwgd12:110	S7:	 it's crucial 
POwgd12:111	S1:	 crucial @ @
POwgd12:112	S2:	 yeah @
POwgd12:113	S1:	 that's quite xx 
POwgd12:114	S2:	 that's terrible we have an agreement with 
POwgd12:115	S8:	 i think it's
POwgd12:116	S2:	 er in in the field of law 
POwgd12:117	S8:	 i think it is 
POwgd12:118	S8:	 yes we put under academic issues 
POwgd12:119	SX-f:	 academic yeah 
POwgd12:120	S2:	 aha 
POwgd12:121	SX-f:	 xxx 
POwgd12:122	S2:	 ah okay 
POwgd12:123	S8:	 so but i i think xxx xx 
POwgd12:124	S2:	 that's was more 
POwgd12:125	S1:	 i think we should 
POwgd12:126	S2:	 that was not not only academic because @
POwgd12:127	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:128	S1:	 yes so in other words to er define the actual degree which will be the type of degree which will be awarded 
POwgd12:129	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:130	S1:	 whether it's going to be a completely joint degree or whether it's going to be 
POwgd12:131	S2:	 double 
POwgd12:132	S1:	 elements 
POwgd12:133	SX-f:	 a double degree 
POwgd12:134	SX-f:	 double 
POwgd12:135	SX-f:	 double or not 
POwgd12:136	SX-3:	 yes or multiple 
POwgd12:137	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:138	S9:	 but i think xxx 
POwgd12:139	S7:	 but these are two different things a double degree and a joint degree 
POwgd12:140	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:141	S2:	 yes 
POwgd12:142	S7:	 completely different 
POwgd12:143	S1:	 oh absolutely but but wh- what we need to do is to be clear 
POwgd12:144	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:145	SX-f:	 xxxxxx 
POwgd12:146	S1:	 from the beginning what 
POwgd12:147	S11:	 yeah @@ what type of degree it's getting that was 
POwgd12:148	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:149	S11:	 it er was a very big part of discussion xx xx 
POwgd12:150	S1:	 oh yes 
POwgd12:151	SS:	 yes yes 
POwgd12:152	S8:	 yeah but it should be discussed before the before setting up the contract 
POwgd12:153	S1:	 so perhaps if we were to make that a separate element in terms of because that that that is such a key question it it needs to come right at the beginning of any discussion 
POwgd12:154	S2:	 which is easier x x 
POwgd12:155	S1:	 yeah er because once that particular question is answered then many of the other things will fall into place afterwards in terms of contracts and agreements 
POwgd12:156	S11:	 at our university for example hh if they decided to create some joint master program hh each university must accreditate this program 
POwgd12:157	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:158	SX-2:	 yes 
POwgd12:159	S11:	 and involves language in czech language and in english language and the same university of [place3] have for example or or in [place4] and that means hh that [name1] university can er give the diploma of [name1] university hh and also the student can get diploma from er from other from four university hh or maybe he can get the diploma with er with with three 
POwgd12:160	SX-f:	 one time one time 
POwgd12:161	S11:	 symbols of these universities three are there 
POwgd12:162	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:163	S11:	 if the program is not accredited that means the students er studying in at home university er receive the diploma of 
POwgd12:164	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:165	S11:	 university and and the confirmation of the studying he did abroad
POwgd12:166	SX-3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:167	S11:	 from other universities from foreign universities only confirmation 
POwgd12:168	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:169	S11:	 and it's up to the university to hhh 
POwgd12:170	S2:	 and the confirmation it's enough 
POwgd12:171	S11:	 confirmation may- 
POwgd12:172	S2:	 it's enough for the labor market for instance 
POwgd12:173	S11:	 may- maybe maybe diploma s- supplement th- the diploma xx xx decide all this things 
POwgd12:174	S2:	 hm 
POwgd12:175	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:176	S11:	 because er the students get will get the diploma supplement it's written where er he studied before with all the times 
POwgd12:177	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:178	S3:	 but that's one of the many differences between double er double degree and joint degree that if it's a joint degree it has to be accredited 
POwgd12:179	S11:	 double it's different 
POwgd12:180	S3:	 that's the whole course if it's a double degree you just have to get accredited your own course 
POwgd12:181	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd12:182	S3:	 that's xxx 
POwgd12:183	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:184	S11:	 double is individual no
POwgd12:185	S3:	 yeah double is 
POwgd12:186	S11:	 double degree is for individual while joint degrees it's for program program 
POwgd12:187	S7:	 standard 
POwgd12:188	S7:	 no the joint degree is 
POwgd12:189	S2:	 no no no it's it's 
POwgd12:190	S11:	 the joint master is for programs 
POwgd12:191	S7:	 three standards 
POwgd12:192	S3:	 yeah but when you get a double degree you'll get two degrees one from 
POwgd12:193	S11:	 yes 
POwgd12:194	S3:	 prague and one from vienna and on the joint degree you have it on one sheet 
POwgd12:195	SX-f:	 yes 
POwgd12:196	S11:	 but double degree is only two partners 
POwgd12:197	S3:	 yeah no it can never be 
POwgd12:198	SS:	 no 
POwgd12:199	S10:	 no 
POwgd12:200	SX-f:	 more 
POwgd12:201	S3:	 at least one 
POwgd12:202	SX-f:	 eight 
POwgd12:203	S3:	 at least xx one it can be five or three 
POwgd12:204	S2:	 yeah more than 
POwgd12:205	S1:	 erm can anybody who was here earlier on thursday explain to me exactly what is mean- meant by erm issue number ten which is the organization of the consortium wha- what what are we speaking about here
POwgd12:206	S7:	 it was the question erm how the consortium between the the member u- er institutions should work but then x should have board er have a board and what tasks of the board 
POwgd12:207	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:208	S7:	 what 
POwgd12:209	S8:	 who is responsible 
POwgd12:210	S7:	 let's say 
POwgd12:211	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd12:212	S7:	 in our experience at least it's turned out to be our crucial question 
POwgd12:213	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:214	S7:	 or it was taking care of the the question that sort of turn up 
POwgd12:215	S1:	 is it xx 
POwgd12:216	S7:	 after it started and 
POwgd12:217	S1:	 so is it in terms of who takes the lead responsibility
POwgd12:218	S7:	 yes probably yes 
POwgd12:219	SX-2:	 inside 
POwgd12:220	S7:	 and you have to well who will have a seat in the board 
POwgd12:221	S5:	 how you er coordinate 
POwgd12:222	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd12:223	S5:	 i mean how the coordination is done between 
POwgd12:224	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd12:225	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:226	SX-3:	 and who does works 
POwgd12:227	S5:	 yeah and who is responsible for the 
POwgd12:228	S1:	 okay i see so it's the practical elements once a consortium decides to set itself up to develop a program this should basically the practical elements as to who who takes full responsibility for which issues 
POwgd12:229	S7:	 the sustainability of the 
POwgd12:230	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:231	S7:	 the work 
POwgd12:232	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:233	S1:	 and er was there any discussion as to whether er different er administrative cultures might have different ways of of dealing with this 
POwgd12:234	SX-5:	 no we didn't get 
POwgd12:235	SX-f:	 no we didn't talk 
POwgd12:236	SX-f:	 no we didn't have time to 
POwgd12:237	S1:	 okay okay all right okay so are are we agreed then that erm in terms of the ten elements we've added on marketing and advertising we've added on er a kind of a caveat of the beginning that there was a need for erm collaboration between the the administrative side and the academic side erm right from the init- the initiat- initiation of a project and are we agreed that in terms of defining the type of degree that's to be given that we will highlight that as a separate issue out of the if you like pull it out of where it is in in this document which is under contracts and agreements and give it erm some emphasis in its own right 
POwgd12:238	S8:	 and then you could also accreditation and xx 
POwgd12:239	S1:	 put accreditation okay 
POwgd12:240	S8:	 under the same point as definition definition of degrees 
POwgd12:241	S1:	 do you mean in terms of national accreditation or whether it's within the university accreditation yeah 
POwgd12:242	S8:	 or 
POwgd12:243	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:244	S1:	 okay so therefore we have erm 
POwgd12:245	S9:	 i think one important point is missing is also maybe it's the x with organization of consortium because the information about or the decision about the selection process about the criteria it must be somewhere within the common website or who is responsible for information for the whole consortia 
POwgd12:246	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:247	S9:	 this is er i think somewhere missing and this is an administrative part xx always in motion to get it available for all partners and students 
POwgd12:248	S1:	 okay in terms of once wha- what you're saying is am i right in thinking that what you're saying is once the consortium has agreed to establish a degree 
POwgd12:249	S9:	 yes 
POwgd12:250	S1:	 in terms of the dissemination of information 
POwgd12:251	S9:	 it's also a question when of marketing er of before that that they should have a information and somewhere is it in for instance in validate the leading of coordinating position is the information about the steps available er avail- er internet page or
POwgd12:252	S1:	 okay so this this links in with the the organization of the consortium 
POwgd12:253	S9:	 somewhere 
POwgd12:254	S9:	 i think it it would be in this part 
POwgd12:255	S1:	 yes so again it comes down to defining the particular roles of the consortium and who who takes responsibility for erm ensuring that internal communication stays on track is is that what you're saying 
POwgd12:256	S9:	 yes 
POwgd12:257	S1:	 okay i i think we can probably safely put that underneath the organization of the consortium as a subelement 
POwgd12:258	S9:	 exactly this is 
POwgd12:259	S9:	 mhm 
POwgd12:260	S1:	 we're yeah okay so will we if if if nobody else has anything to add to that will we make some attempt at putting those in order i mean those elements er those questions those issues that have been brought er out here in this document where we are not going to add any more do i take it that we are all happy with what we have 
POwgd12:261	S8:	 may- maybe we could add what we are doing th- the the time this this 
POwgd12:262	S1:	 the time frame 
POwgd12:263	S8:	 time frame we may- maybe we we could add some questions when we find out that that the er more questions about the second xx like 
POwgd12:264	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:265	S8:	 l- let's say the point er collaboration of administrative and academic xx x x 
POwgd12:266	S1:	 yes xx 
POwgd12:267	S8:	 and then we could set up a few questions 
POwgd12:268	S1:	 mhm as we go forward yes so i mean 
POwgd12:269	SX-8:	 x x xxxx 
POwgd12:270	S1:	 but i think that probably for the time being we can move on to the next stage which is trying to er define a erm a a a a time frame for these various issues as to which comes first and which might come er at the end so we were talking in terms of the first thing that we said was erm just if you like the the proviso that erm that we need for academic and administrative to to work together that that that's i suppose should be taken for granted but isn't isn't always and then if we look at the we we mentioned that the definition of the degree was was critical from the beginning but perhaps what would be the first one maybe is the organization of a consortium 
POwgd12:271	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:272	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:273	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:274	S1:	 would people agree with that
POwgd12:275	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:276	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:277	S1:	 in that i would include your suggestion there about you know erm who looks after the internal communication and erm who takes the lead responsibility because that that's that's often erm absolutely essential to have somebody erm who is prepared to do the applicant to er making it it happen erm and i think at that stage too you need to be clear about the funding that's available to the consortium 
POwgd12:278	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:279	S1:	 okay if we try and do this first as a very rough time frame and then we we can go back to it erm and and shift it around if we we decide otherwise if we take that that's the organization of the consortium erm we've got the the funding there should we have contracts and agreements i mean where where is that fitting into the 
POwgd12:280	S8:	 i think it fits er maybe right er at the beginning 
POwgd12:281	S2:	 the beginning 
POwgd12:282	S8:	 if if you have a letter o- of intent 
POwgd12:283	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:284	S8:	 it should be at the beginning 
POwgd12:285	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:286	S8:	 if you don't then it can be afterwards you know it really depends 
POwgd12:287	S2:	 generally it's better on the beginning a very clear letter 
POwgd12:288	S8:	 yes but if you don't have a project which is well defined then 
POwgd12:289	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:290	S8:	 sometimes it's very difficult to er set up an agreement you know 
POwgd12:291	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:292	SX-3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:293	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:294	S5:	 yeah first you have to roughly design the project 
POwgd12:295	S8:	 you have to er er framework 
POwgd12:296	S2:	 decide project 
POwgd12:297	S5:	 a financial plan and then you have a xx letter 
POwgd12:298	S8:	 so you have 
POwgd12:299	S8:	 so you have 
POwgd12:300	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:301	S8:	 for instance you would have to define mobility before you know having the the before setting up er the agreement but if we depends if you do a letter of intent the same we gonna do this 
POwgd12:302	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:303	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:304	S8:	 then you you do from the beginning 
POwgd12:305	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:306	S8:	 but if it's very specific you know agreement about how you can do the joint degree then it it's really at the end 
POwgd12:307	S3:	 well it depends what kind of letter of intent you intend to @
POwgd12:308	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:309	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:310	S8:	 yeah 
POwgd12:311	S2:	 yeah @@@
POwgd12:312	S8:	 it's 
POwgd12:313	S3:	 who should make this who should sign this 
POwgd12:314	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:315	S3:	 the rector won't sign a letter of intent if if you don't have a financial plan on the other hand 
POwgd12:316	S1:	 @@@
POwgd12:317	S3:	 @ er i think there is 
POwgd12:318	S8:	 i think funding has to come er before 
POwgd12:319	S3:	 pardon
POwgd12:320	S8:	 has to be funding has to be defined before 
POwgd12:321	S3:	 you you can't you can't make a financial plan before you have the purchase structure before you have a rough curricula structure you can't make the funding before 
POwgd12:322	S2:	 how many students go abroad for how long
POwgd12:323	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:324	S1:	 but you could have a very dra- er general er letter of intent you know er at at this 
POwgd12:325	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:326	S1:	 s- stage where you're setting up a consortium to run this 
POwgd12:327	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:328	SX-2:	 who should do that who should sign that 
POwgd12:329	S1:	 erm erm 
POwgd12:330	S5:	 or 
POwgd12:331	S2:	 the scientific the scientific leader just the scientific leader not the rector 
POwgd12:332	SS:	 xxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:333	S5:	 it's xxxxxxx to understand this yeah xxx understanding that we're going to work together towards this aim 
POwgd12:334	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:335	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd12:336	SS:	 xxxxx 
POwgd12:337	S2:	 yeah but there's no sense 
POwgd12:338	SS:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:339	S3:	 because if you'll do it the other side round er if there's no letter of intent the academics won't work on on this project 
POwgd12:340	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:341	S5:	 well it depends sometimes sometimes there is more 
POwgd12:342	S11:	 sometimes it must be recommended by the dean by the faculty and then the rector will also sign it 
POwgd12:343	SX-7:	 yes 
POwgd12:344	S11:	 because letter of intent it's some common wish to cooperate it's it's all 
POwgd12:345	SX-f:	 hm
POwgd12:346	SX-f:	 i think it xxx 
POwgd12:347	S3:	 well it depends on the structure of of the university 
POwgd12:348	S11:	 mhm 
POwgd12:349	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:350	S3:	 also erm 
POwgd12:351	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:352	S1:	 er are we are we saying here that at the stage at the initial stage erm the organization of the consortium 
POwgd12:353	S3:	 some 
POwgd12:354	S1:	 hh that erm this is where there's a need for a letter of intent or are we saying that the letter of intent actually starts the whole process you know in other words 
POwgd12:355	SX-f:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:356	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:357	S1:	 you need a letter of intent to 
POwgd12:358	SS:	 yes yes xxxxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:359	S1:	 before you move to the organization of the consortium 
POwgd12:360	S8:	 yes i- it really depends on the structure of the university 
POwgd12:361	S4:	 a conviction that at the general assembly all [org1] rectors having expressed interest in joint programs sign sort of a common declaration or a letter of in- er intent a memorandum of understanding call it whatever you want 
POwgd12:362	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:363	S4:	 and actually pledge to put aside some sort of funding or resources within the university to even investigate 
POwgd12:364	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:365	S4:	 possibilities 
POwgd12:366	S6:	 no you can't do that 
POwgd12:367	S1:	 i don't think you can do that it wouldn't work within my structure 
POwgd12:368	S2:	 you can't no 
POwgd12:369	S8:	 no not within mine 
POwgd12:370	S1:	 er 
POwgd12:371	S4:	 i mean if if if i can just take it for example my university it's it's it's a prioritized area for the rector 
POwgd12:372	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:373	S4:	 and if they're seriously considering erm one thing to to s- s- sort of further this type of cooperation yes perhaps we should consider actually putting xxx 
POwgd12:374	S6:	 yes but all universities are not funded in the same way 
POwgd12:375	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd12:376	S6:	 and in some sorts of university rectors don't have funds to dispose so you just can't make it general practice 
POwgd12:377	S1:	 i i think yes you know i think that's true because i think here we're running into differences between er if you like national cultures erm as to the way things are done 
POwgd12:378	SX-f:	
POwgd12:379	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:380	S1:	 erm because the way i would see something like this erm working in my university is where the academics so the head of a particular department or a faculty would indicate their agreement to move forward in a very general way erm to e- exploring this and that could be the initial stage er setting up er a group erm you know to define a a program but there would not be it could not be the case that i could go up to the president of the university and say can you give your erm er you know er e- express your approval now for this and your support for any funding tha- that just would not happen so i i think a more general erm letter of intent from er th- the responsible academic erm either department or faculty would be would be the way we would erm make this progress because i i don't think you're going to have [first name1] coming on to everything you signed free and deliberate and the- you know they would sure it is going to run 
POwgd12:381	S4:	 i shou- should say there are different practices 
POwgd12:382	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:383	S4:	 having heard about the [org1] [name2] yesterday it was it was the exact opposite of course 
POwgd12:384	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:385	S4:	 erm so yes 
POwgd12:386	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:387	S4:	 a general letter in- intent yes by all means 
POwgd12:388	S1:	 and so 
POwgd12:389	SX-f:	 although 
POwgd12:390	S1:	 yes and going back to trying to define the the time frame are we saying really we should be putting the general letter of intent a- at the beginning before the the setting up of the you know before the organization of the consortium if you like once the letter of intent comes then you can define in the consortium what's what's to be done 
POwgd12:391	S8:	 maybe we should put that it really depends on the on the er
POwgd12:392	SX-f:	 can i structure 
POwgd12:393	S6:	 can i give you an example
POwgd12:394	S1:	 sure 
POwgd12:395	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:396	S6:	 so er one we we're working on now erm in [name3] on the in neuroscience what actually happened was that the hh the main academic activator who happens to be an extremely powerful person in the institution xxxx 
POwgd12:397	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:398	S6:	 no er it's a project of his for years 
POwgd12:399	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:400	S6:	 so he must be i don't know privately working on it with colleagues in [place2] 
POwgd12:401	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:402	S6:	 he got er er provost interim provost is the rector er 
POwgd12:403	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:404	S6:	 interested erm and so provost and i and this er activator went to [place2] in er un moment october 
POwgd12:405	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:406	S6:	 had a meeting and a very general meeting which we basically agreed that x x xx possible and as a result of that 
POwgd12:407	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:408	S6:	 a letter of intent memora- -andum of understanding was drafted 
POwgd12:409	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:410	S6:	 and in extremely vague terms 
POwgd12:411	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:412	S6:	 but so actually although it's in one se- sense the beginning 
POwgd12:413	S1:	 yes perhaps 
POwgd12:414	SX-f:	 there has to be x beforehand yes yes 
POwgd12:415	S6:	 it's the actually the end 
POwgd12:416	S2:	 they are not xxx 
POwgd12:417	S1:	 xxxxx some other things yes 
POwgd12:418	S2:	 the same we did at xx xxx xx- xxx 
POwgd12:419	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:420	S2:	 we did it the same way we had a meeting with the dean in the faculty of law and and the dean of the faculty of law [place5] and [place2] together and we sign a letter of a general letter then we state that six months to develop this this project 
POwgd12:421	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:422	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:423	S8:	 as far as we are concerned i i think we we there is no need to si- to sign anything 
POwgd12:424	S2:	 aha 
POwgd12:425	S8:	 you know until the xxx x x x is set up 
POwgd12:426	S4:	 aha 
POwgd12:427	S8:	 so that's it really depends the different that xxxx 
POwgd12:428	S2:	 mhm it depends 
POwgd12:429	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:430	S8:	 so 
POwgd12:431	S1:	 would it would it be useful to say that a letter of intent a general letter of intent is probably ideal 
POwgd12:432	S8:	 yes i think so 
POwgd12:433	S1:	 er and we're we're all assuming erm taking your point [S6] w- we we're assuming that the stage we're at we're trying to define here is the end of a further long process of collaboration and discussion 
POwgd12:434	SX-5:	 well the stages of which you can't really put xxx because it's personal and it depends on xxx 
POwgd12:435	S1:	 you can't no you can't define xx 
POwgd12:436	S1:	 it's individual yes yes okay so we have a general letter of intent then we're saying the organization of the consortium er needs to be teased out as to you know such issues as to erm who's who's taking the lead responsibility erm funding erm who's taking responsibility for dispersing funds if there are funds available erm er internal communication issues such as that and 
POwgd12:437	S6:	 and also at that stage what funding structures are 
POwgd12:438	S1:	 precisely 
POwgd12:439	S6:	 cos otherwise people make assumptions that all funding structures are the same 
POwgd12:440	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:441	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:442	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:443	S6:	 so it need to be clear to partners how it works 
POwgd12:444	S2:	 from the first beginning 
POwgd12:445	S1:	 yes mhm 
POwgd12:446	SX-f:	
POwgd12:447	S1:	 so there needs to be clarity on on a lot of organizational issues at that stage and we mentioned funding erm as coming after the organization of the consortium how how are we going to define where exactly erm the fu- you know the funding issues come into play and 
POwgd12:448	S12:	 y- you can turn it all around 
POwgd12:449	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:450	S12:	 and and if if you say in in the beginning that you have let's say an intent for hh supporting initiatives that will lead to the creation of international networks or international hh masters or international research cooperation hh erm then of course i think you have to immediately indicate 
POwgd12:451	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:452	S12:	 what the type of funding is related to the type of initiatives that are developed 
POwgd12:453	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:454	S12:	 so what what i tried to explain yesterday er in the afternoon is that we were a little bit surprised on the one hand we had er a call for interest that was really supported by the rector and and and the people hh responsible for international relation so a very centralized thing and we said okay hh this is the type of seed money that you can get if you fulfil 
POwgd12:455	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:456	S12:	 er a number of criteria such as a research based projects er having already a concrete link with er let's say some international partners et cetera et cetera hh so out of this came virtually nothing because people well virtually nothing is a little bit too pessimistic but it was a very limited range of projects that came out of it because people knew that the type of incentives that we were offering was in fact very small as opposed to 
POwgd12:457	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:458	S12:	 the type of effort that is 
POwgd12:459	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:460	S12:	 to be engaged in in in this type of development and then next to x that i indicated we had the funding affair there with th- the call for leonardo projects which we didn't steer at all centrally but it was known that there was really erm even a possibility to to get enough money to er engage people 
POwgd12:461	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:462	S12:	 so er and and and this was then well it was taken up by by the departments just in a spontaneous way because they knew that there was really a significant hh way of of getting assistance er also er a a funding high enough as to enable to engage supplementary people in the project and hh and this is i think in in educational matters very important normally it's only for research that you get funds high enough to to really attract supplementary people and the the the order of magnitude of of the types of funds that are leonardo funds they really allow people to hh well to create supplementary er f t e @@ full-time equivalents and and and in view of the of of the amount of work to be done that's that's in fact necessary because otherwise it comes on top of the workload of the already dynamic and already very engaged persons that then are are hh er probably the the right people to activate th- this kind of er hh so i think it's it's necessary to to indicate or to have a list of potential er funding 
POwgd12:463	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:464	S12:	 and the different types of funding and and er i- in the end of course the best thing is to combine things to combine research funding er development funding and seed money 
POwgd12:465	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:466	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:467	S12:	 and and then you really get to an amount of money that that becomes attractive it's not that people are doing it for the money don't misunderstand me 
POwgd12:468	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:469	S2:	 they do they do 
POwgd12:470	S12:	 b- b- 
POwgd12:471	S2:	 @@
POwgd12:472	S12:	 but b- but it's it's just because the they it's a type of money that they cannot really use for themselves but but it 
POwgd12:473	S2:	 no 
POwgd12:474	S12:	 it they they need it in order to supplement the funds that they have in their department to do new things and 
POwgd12:475	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:476	S1:	 of course for you the question then ris- arises i mean there're there're different ways of approaching erm the development of some sort of joint er 
POwgd12:477	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:478	S1:	 degree it it maybe like the urban studies where people are taking in existing 
POwgd12:479	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:480	S12:	 yeah then you can do a structure 
POwgd12:481	S1:	 erm 
POwgd12:482	S1:	 and that's that's a different thing 
POwgd12:483	SX-9:	 that's 
POwgd12:484	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:485	S1:	 to 
POwgd12:486	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:487	S1:	 er finding er funding to develop a new curriculum 
POwgd12:488	S12:	 voila 
POwgd12:489	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:490	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:491	S1:	 so so th- there're there're there're there're different things involved here th- that w- we need to take account of a- and the funding might be more or less important depending on whether you're dealing with something that's so xxxxxx 
POwgd12:492	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:493	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:494	S12:	 with a maximum of xx scenario 
POwgd12:495	SS:	 xxxxx 
POwgd12:496	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:497	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:498	S2:	 that's the call for proposal our ministry had done that will be handed in february the- they put a a sort of amount for different type and different country and that we know we can apply to have a double degree or a erm double p h d degree and with different country and i mean and different kind 
POwgd12:499	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:500	S2:	 that's why er is th- the starting then we have to combine maybe with socrates with maybe with internal internal funding but is the base we we know that we have we can manage with some money from the ministry 
POwgd12:501	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:502	S2:	 of research of education 
POwgd12:503	S1:	 okay a- at the moment we have what we have written down is erm the very first stage based on some work before er letter of a general letter of intent next stage organization of a consortium we've mentioned the funding as the next er element and then contracts and agreements where in all of this do we put in the definition of the degree because we mentioned at the beginning of the meeting about twenty minutes ago that that's that's a critical erm question that needs to be addressed right at the beginning of setting up a consortium so where in in in in terms of this time frame do we include that crucial thing erm where people have are clear about the the type of degree that needs to be awarded i are we all assuming that this needs to be clarified before people move on 
POwgd12:504	S3:	 also for my understanding it should be clarified 
POwgd12:505	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:506	SX-f:	 yes 
POwgd12:507	S1:	 yes i i would think so 
POwgd12:508	S3:	 very very at the beginning 
POwgd12:509	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:510	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:511	S3:	 because there's s- there's so many things depending on it 
POwgd12:512	SX-f:	 @ yes 
POwgd12:513	S1:	 [S6] you'd might like to 
POwgd12:514	SS:	 xxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:515	SX-f:	 on the beginning is everything 
POwgd12:516	S6:	 i just wanted to say they all have to have a curriculum @@@
POwgd12:517	SX-f:	 @@@
POwgd12:518	S2:	 yeah @@@
POwgd12:519	SS:	 @@@
POwgd12:520	S6:	 we will thwart [first name1] in one of the stages 
POwgd12:521	S1:	 yeah at er 
POwgd12:522	S2:	 yeah @
POwgd12:523	S1:	 in terms of your experience er [S6] erm have you any er points to make here as to when it might be feasible or is it feasible 
POwgd12:524	S6:	 well i think it's er up to the world is changing of course 
POwgd12:525	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:526	S6:	 a- and new things are happening and new things which become impossible that weren't possible before but up to now it will be being determined by who the partners are 
POwgd12:527	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:528	S6:	 it is determined by the legal frameworks which most partners operate 
POwgd12:529	S1:	 so does yeah 
POwgd12:530	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:531	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:532	S6:	 erm and in er hh so for example in the f- french case it is the french state that offers offers a qualification in the u k case it is the individual institutions that offers a qualification 
POwgd12:533	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:534	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:535	S6:	 so up to now it is been nearly impossible to do a joint degree with the french state 
POwgd12:536	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:537	S6:	 hh so it had to be double 
POwgd12:538	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:539	S6:	 but actually that's now changing we are negotiating with the french state so at so 
POwgd12:540	S1:	 so it's 
POwgd12:541	S6:	 it's the choice of partners the the xxxx 
POwgd12:542	S1:	 okay yes yes so in in terms of our time frame if we we come now to contracts and agreements so we're still are we s- are we still happy that erm the type of degree we have said first of all that we might pull that out as er a central issue to be tackled erm or do we do we keep it here as maybe the one the first thing that that needs to be dealt with within the the consortium i- i- in terms of contracts and agreements 
POwgd12:543	S12:	 er in fact as long as we don't have what i call the political power as to impose or willingness 
POwgd12:544	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:545	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:546	S12:	 as regarded to the type of 
POwgd12:547	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:548	S12:	 result that we want i i think that it depends on the network 
POwgd12:549	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:550	S12:	 that you are dealing with so if you have a subsegment of [org1] 
POwgd12:551	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:552	S12:	 which enables you to do a real joint degree 
POwgd12:553	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:554	S12:	 then go for it 
POwgd12:555	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:556	S12:	 but if it doesn't then don't stop because of it 
POwgd12:557	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:558	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:559	S12:	 so i'm not sure that this is something that you have to clarify right in the beginning hh you can perhaps set a maximum target but having to come down from that maximum target in my view is not essential 
POwgd12:560	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:561	S12:	 as for the collaboration n- not in the sense that er let's say the team or or the er the contents is is essential 
POwgd12:562	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:563	S6:	 you can have a fully integrated program with a really genuinely joint without actually having a joint degree at all 
POwgd12:564	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:565	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:566	S6:	 it's just a piece of paper 
POwgd12:567	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:568	S7:	 within the the consortium you can have joint degree with one institu- -tution and a double curriculum with another one 
POwgd12:569	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:570	S7:	 and then with a dipo- diploma a national degree with a diploma supplement with a third one j- just have to clarify wha- wha- what opt- opt- options are that they are 
POwgd12:571	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:572	S7:	 there are all possible within the same consortium 
POwgd12:573	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd12:574	S12:	 in general it does also not very much affect the type of supplementary funding that you need to go on 
POwgd12:575	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:576	S12:	 with the collaboration so it's also something that your rector or the administrative top of university is not going to be really it it's it's not going to result into a veto don't do it because it's a double degree and not a joint degree 
POwgd12:577	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:578	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:579	S12:	 that that's not a kind of reaction you're going to get from the top so in my view it's 
POwgd12:580	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:581	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:582	S12:	 as long as we cannot reach the real thing er er it's it's not that important in this stage 
POwgd12:583	S1:	 mhm okay 
POwgd12:584	S12:	 we know that as as of the diversity of europe 
POwgd12:585	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:586	S12:	 er it just results into well what i call the academic engineering for the moment 
POwgd12:587	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:588	S12:	 because we don't have a general rule 
POwgd12:589	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:590	S12:	 er bologna is there but it did not lead to a transparency in in or or certainly not to a homogeneous landscape 
POwgd12:591	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:592	S12:	 as for the type of of er issue in degrees so and and and and allowing for collaboration so hh okay it's like that we are as as er [first name1] said we are not going to change the the german legislation out of our chairs here so er 
POwgd12:593	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:594	S3:	 er may i just add one thing well you're right concerning the curriculum and the content and you're right concerning the funding but erm on the other hand erm what do you xx from students erm w- hh well you are you are developing a curriculum and after that you 
POwgd12:595	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:596	S3:	 er you decide well on the one hand it's a double degree on the other hand it's just just er in the in the diploma supplement on the joint degree 
POwgd12:597	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:598	S3:	 i don't think that this works and on and the second aspect is erm hh we can make a oder we could make a joint degree with the u k legally from the from the deg- er from the er degree but er we cannot select the students we are not allowed to erm that the students pay tuition fees so er we we could have a joint degree but we can't we couldn't make the full program so what do you say to the students what do you commit to the students
POwgd12:599	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:600	S12:	 yeah but 
POwgd12:601	S3:	 before they start in the 
POwgd12:602	S12:	 but that's another stage 
POwgd12:603	S3:	 if you don't 
POwgd12:604	S12:	 i mean at the end of of of the the the development f- er at the end of course the network has to say it's this or that 
POwgd12:605	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:606	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:607	S12:	 but i i'm sorry to say i don't know that the average er i don't think that the average s- students knows the difference between a double degree or a joint degree or 
POwgd12:608	S3:	 no 
POwgd12:609	S12:	 or whatever it's just the way of 
POwgd12:610	S3:	 no no not the difference x 
POwgd12:611	S12:	 marketing it to the students but er 
POwgd12:612	SX-f:	 xxxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:613	S3:	 but there is a difference if they are ordinary student if tha- if this is a a ordinary study course or it's something beside or outside the universities 
POwgd12:614	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:615	S3:	 it's a so-called postgraduate master 
POwgd12:616	S12:	 oh yes 
POwgd12:617	S10:	 voila here it is 
POwgd12:618	S12:	 of course of course of course of course 
POwgd12:619	S3:	 that's that's a great difference yes 
POwgd12:620	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:621	S12:	 bu- but in in the end you'll have this result and that's the result that you will have to market to the students of course it's impossible to start hh er advertising the program without knowing about th- the b- but you you can decide it in the last stage of of your collaboration 
POwgd12:622	S3:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:623	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:624	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:625	S12:	 the final decision 
POwgd12:626	S1:	 well well 
POwgd12:627	SX-f:	 no 
POwgd12:628	S1:	 i mean i think it's true to say that you have to allow a certain amount of flexibility so that as the consortium gets under way you know there there is freedom to 
POwgd12:629	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:630	S1:	 change it adapt it a little bit but 
POwgd12:631	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:632	S1:	 i think it's also clear that you if you don't know as somebody said earlier if you don't know where you're going 
POwgd12:633	SX-f:	 ah 
POwgd12:634	S1:	 and how you're going to get there and 
POwgd12:635	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:636	S1:	 so that you really my my feeling would be that right from the beginning you need a very clear idea 
POwgd12:637	S8:	 where to go 
POwgd12:638	S1:	 erm what what you're going 
POwgd12:639	S8:	 what's your target 
POwgd12:640	S1:	 what s- yes what sort of degree we are talking about 
POwgd12:641	S12:	 hh i completely agree but i i give you an example which is not even an international one but even more diff- th- it proved to be more difficult in [place6] than international joint degree 
POwgd12:642	SS:	 @@
POwgd12:643	S12:	 that was a degree er er a joint degree b- over flanders and the walloon part of the country so in [place7] we are er we have a a typical er type of er hh engineers that we call business engineers from the [name4] institute and th- they have like a combination of er technical erm hh er curric- er 
POwgd12:644	S8:	 xxx 
POwgd12:645	S12:	 part of the curriculum hh and and and and business er erm and financial marketing advising hh so we have these two institutes the institute [name4] of the u l b and the national school [name4] of the v u b and we're trying to make a joint degree and and we were starting of course with the idea of a a j- joint degree and in the end we will have to register register them at u l b and and and make like a double degree because of well all kind of legislative problems between the two communities but this doesn't mean if you want t- to realize this in [place7] that you have to call off the project be- because of this 
POwgd12:646	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:647	S12:	 er then it means that i- in in th- in the contract between the partners in the end you have to include all kind of paragraphs in order to to compensate for in fact the format that you didn't really want but it's if if the feeling and the vision is strong enough to realize it then this does not have to be 
POwgd12:648	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:649	S12:	 er let's say a factor 
POwgd12:650	SX-3:	 you want to come in [S10] 
POwgd12:651	S10:	 yes erm i think there are two different sides of the same coin 
POwgd12:652	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:653	S10:	 the first question is how the diploma can be x yes and then 
POwgd12:654	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:655	S10:	 i ask me the question i am for instance the director of [org2] in malta 
POwgd12:656	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:657	S10:	 and i have two diplomas 
POwgd12:658	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:659	S10:	 and i read this 
POwgd12:660	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:661	S10:	 and what does it say this diploma to me 
POwgd12:662	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:663	S10:	 yeah what i know about the qualification of the two different persons yeah
POwgd12:664	S9:	 but you will get the one diploma supplement that shows they are all xxx 
POwgd12:665	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:666	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:667	SS:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:668	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:669	SX-2:	 in the future 
POwgd12:670	S9:	 xx different universities this is a crucial thing the diploma xx xxx show all 
POwgd12:671	S8:	 yeah but you might not take your time to read this 
POwgd12:672	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:673	S8:	 you know if you're xxx if you're you know 
POwgd12:674	S12:	 ooph 
POwgd12:675	S12:	 bu- bu- bu- 
POwgd12:676	S9:	 they do so 
POwgd12:677	S12:	 but the employers from [org2] 
POwgd12:678	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:679	S8:	 it should be xxxxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:680	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:681	S12:	 he won't 
POwgd12:682	S8:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:683	S2:	 he doesn't know 
POwgd12:684	S12:	 he doesn't know the difference between all this 
POwgd12:685	S8:	 xxxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:686	S2:	 he doesn't know the difference 
POwgd12:687	S10:	 he doesn't know the difference 
POwgd12:688	S12:	 so he he looks at the universities i think the names of the universities that are on there 
POwgd12:689	S10:	 we know 
POwgd12:690	S8:	 xxxxxxx 
POwgd12:691	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:692	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:693	S12:	 and he looks at the diploma supplement because in the diploma supple- supplement the curriculum and and and and er 
POwgd12:694	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:695	S2:	 is written 
POwgd12:696	S12:	 is written down and and the responsibility of both partners in the curriculum and i think that in the end is the imp- i- if it is in co-organization or joint degree or or double er denom- er 
POwgd12:697	S1:	 well 
POwgd12:698	S12:	 i think 
POwgd12:699	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:700	S12:	 it it's all in the explanation of the diploma supplement 
POwgd12:701	S8:	 what you said is that at the beginning you decided to go for a joint degree 
POwgd12:702	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:703	S8:	 and then you realized that it wasn't possible 
POwgd12:704	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:705	S8:	 and you fi- found a- another so- sol- solution 
POwgd12:706	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:707	S8:	 so i think the er the er a- at the beginning you have to decide something you know we are gonna do something let's say we gonna do a joint degree 
POwgd12:708	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:709	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:710	S9:	 and then you f- you you s- 
POwgd12:711	S12:	 on the way 
POwgd12:712	S9:	 see on the way how you can make this 
POwgd12:713	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:714	S1:	 i think so allowing for 
POwgd12:715	S10:	 yes but i'm xxx 
POwgd12:716	S12:	 a- and it's not necessarily sorry 
POwgd12:717	S10:	 no 
POwgd12:718	S12:	 to to to give up this idea 
POwgd12:719	S8:	 yeah 
POwgd12:720	S12:	 i mean you can start like this and then 
POwgd12:721	SX-f:	 yes 
POwgd12:722	S12:	 along the way legislators realize that they have in fact the contradictory things let's say within the framework of the state of [place6] and you try to introduce 
POwgd12:723	S2:	 but it's difficult 
POwgd12:724	S9:	 but 
POwgd12:725	S12:	 legislative proposals in order to to be able to realize the the the joint degree that you want to realize 
POwgd12:726	S1:	 erm 
POwgd12:727	S12:	 but this is a long process if you have to wait 
POwgd12:728	S1:	 but 
POwgd12:729	S12:	 before legislation is changed the xx three years or four years of xx so 
POwgd12:730	S1:	 could i 
POwgd12:731	SX-f:	 xxxxxxx 
POwgd12:732	S1:	 it it may well be that some of these issues may already have been teased out in the preliminary discussions you know the the type of collaboration that's that's that's been undertaken before people actually get to the stage 
POwgd12:733	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:734	S1:	 of of defining th- er this you know and and agreeing establishing a consortium a lot of this will have been talked about erm at length i'm sure and people will have a good understanding as to what's what's what's possible and it will only be those people who see a possibility for erm serious collaboration that will go ahead anyway so perhaps we can assume that some of this has already been erm er debated already and while it hasn't been fully clarified it's been clarified sufficiently for people to agree that they're working towards this so that if we come back to our time frame and we got the organization of the consortium and i would imagine we actually need to pull out erm that the consortium needs to have a clear erm er organization and legal structure at that stage for itself you know so you need that that element of contracts and agreements can actually be i would imagine subdivided up in terms of of the procedures but you would need at the beginning of the organization i would suggest that you need to have some kind of formal agreement as to how the organization is going to be structured and and managed and then we have funding and then we have erm w- we were talking about contracts and agreements in general but it maybe that at that stage we should be saying that the main element here to be er defined straight away is is th- the basic objective as to what type of degree people are are trying to are aiming to to to provide 
POwgd12:735	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:736	S1:	 in terms of a 
POwgd12:737	S9:	 i think because later if i go into a mobility scheme this depends very much on what what kind of degree 
POwgd12:738	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:739	S9:	 you are going 
POwgd12:740	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:741	S9:	 to have or xx xx besides it's important that's just in the beginning of this 
POwgd12:742	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:743	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:744	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:745	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:746	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:747	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:748	S1:	 i think so 
POwgd12:749	S12:	 ideally of course we should as [org1] members provide perhaps er like er an updated version but then i- in a in a shortened way because if if you read th- the the national decrees or the regional decrees it's hh it's very complex stuff and it's not easy when when in fact when you you have a new er initiative people have to do with all over again 
POwgd12:750	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:751	S12:	 a- at for each project so it might be very useful that every [org1] member erm would erm be prepared to f- f- er like i don't know create a website or or or give in information that is updated all the time as for the hh the the possible types of degree that they can 
POwgd12:752	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:753	S12:	 er that they can handle within their own country 
POwgd12:754	S8:	 that was the idea er the idea of [first name2] was the the xxx you know that er 
POwgd12:755	SX-f:	 xx 
POwgd12:756	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:757	S8:	 that you should be xxx so that with some specific questions like these 
POwgd12:758	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:759	S8:	 er you can so so it gives you an idea very pretty xx matrix 
POwgd12:760	S12:	 if so wanna s- s- if you wanna start a degree with [place6] and you have to have 
POwgd12:761	S9:	 yeah 
POwgd12:762	S1:	 okay so so 
POwgd12:763	S12:	 admit the individual department 
POwgd12:764	S1:	 that that if you like is the that's that's obviously very valid that that's apart from from this particular discussion here 
POwgd12:765	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:766	S8:	 yes 
POwgd12:767	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:768	S1:	 so we have you could mention that that is something that that we could be doing and going back to our our time frame here and we were at the stage of defining the type of degree what would be xx pull out the next as the the next before we're trying to put this into er er a sense of order what would people suggest could be the next erm element we should pull out erm at being th- the next stage erm of this process 
POwgd12:769	S5:	 perhaps organizing the xx consortium then 
POwgd12:770	S1:	 we we have yeah we have defined the the organized the consortium we have the letter of intent and organized the consortium and organized the with with you know as a a legal or and administrative entity we we've talked about the funding as being next so i think that's clarified 
POwgd12:771	S12:	 xxx 
POwgd12:772	S1:	 then we've talked about defining the type of degree 
POwgd12:773	S12:	 internal communication 
POwgd12:774	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:775	S5:	 then we should er organize er the teaching 
POwgd12:776	S1:	 the teaching mhm 
POwgd12:777	S5:	 the content 
POwgd12:778	SS:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:779	S9:	 the academic part is coming now 
POwgd12:780	SX-5:	 yeah yeah yeah the academic part xxxx xxxx 
POwgd12:781	S1:	 th- th- the academic part 
POwgd12:782	S2:	 the academic part 
POwgd12:783	SX-f:	 it is important 
POwgd12:784	S12:	 what is written here what is mhm 
POwgd12:785	S1:	 mhm [S6] would you agree with that 
POwgd12:786	S12:	 xxx 
POwgd12:787	S6:	 yes because you can't er go on with things like exams 
POwgd12:788	S12:	 xxx 
POwgd12:789	S1:	 you can't or e c t s utterly would 
POwgd12:790	S2:	 no no no 
POwgd12:791	SS:	 xxxx xxxx xxx x x x x 
POwgd12:792	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:793	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:794	S5:	 you need the whole lot of the content and the academic part of the 
POwgd12:795	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:796	S1:	 so we we need to 
POwgd12:797	S5:	 the const- 
POwgd12:798	S2:	 know 
POwgd12:799	S1:	 somebody needs to be erm defining the academic content and the structure 
POwgd12:800	S2:	 involved 
POwgd12:801	S1:	 the academic structure 
POwgd12:802	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwgd12:803	S6:	 yeah and the movement for the the movement they want 
POwgd12:804	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:805	S12:	 and the
POwgd12:806	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:807	S12:	 i didn't hear 
POwgd12:808	S1:	 the movement she said 
POwgd12:809	S6:	 the movement 
POwgd12:810	SX-f:	 the movement 
POwgd12:811	S12:	 ah aha okay 
POwgd12:812	S1:	 yeah so in other words 
POwgd12:813	S6:	 xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxx 
POwgd12:814	S12:	 yeah one term to term 
POwgd12:815	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:816	S8:	 so it's movement and m- mobility 
POwgd12:817	S5:	 okay so who'll who normally is responsible for that is er the one that has the idea the department er because in our case for example the department has the initiative and then er the department some needs er the proposal the content of the proposal er to the postgradua- postgraduate studies committee which is senate committee hh er so as to er clarify everything and sort out everything regarding the academic er part er of the proposal and after everything is approved and cleared out then er the proposal is submitted to international relations committee 
POwgd12:818	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:819	SX-f:	 yes 
POwgd12:820	S5:	 for er for approval 
POwgd12:821	S1:	 yes so there will be internal 
POwgd12:822	S5:	 er 
POwgd12:823	S1:	 procedures in each university that need to 
POwgd12:824	S5:	 yes so we have to know to see now what 
POwgd12:825	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:826	S5:	 should be the internal procedures 
POwgd12:827	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:828	S5:	 w- wha- what no normally what procedures internally are 
POwgd12:829	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:830	S3:	 may i 
POwgd12:831	S12:	 the academic part of the proposal 
POwgd12:832	SX-f:	 xx xxxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:833	S2:	 we have two steps 
POwgd12:834	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:835	S3:	 may i come back
POwgd12:836	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:837	S3:	 because she talks the postgraduate i think one one one question which should be defined r- at really at er er at qui- at quite an early stage is is it a graduate or postgraduate program
POwgd12:838	S1:	 is it sorry
POwgd12:839	S3:	 it's an er graduate or postgraduate program 
POwgd12:840	S1:	 yeah well yes 
POwgd12:841	S12:	 it depends 
POwgd12:842	S1:	 well 
POwgd12:843	S5:	 yeah the main course the postgraduate program yeah 
POwgd12:844	S1:	 i i think we're talking here about the postgraduate yes master's programs yeah perhaps 
POwgd12:845	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:846	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:847	S5:	 i mean master's program yes 
POwgd12:848	S1:	 erm i mean it could be used as a i suppose as a template for for a for a for a doctoral but i think that the emphasis is in this discussion is o- at the master's level 
POwgd12:849	S3:	 fuer das dass die alles xx als ein postgraduate definieren 
POwgd12:850	SS:	 xxxx xxxx 
POwgd12:851	S12:	 master level yeah 
POwgd12:852	S5:	 it's the same committee for us for i mean the the master's program the doctoral programs 
POwgd12:853	S10:	 ja 
POwgd12:854	S3:	 ja 
POwgd12:855	S3:	 was wir ja noch nicht haben

POwgd12:887	S12:	 but in general for the post-master degrees 
POwgd12:888	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:889	S12:	 in most countries there is more flexibility so 
POwgd12:890	S3:	 yeah much more 
POwgd12:891	S12:	 as for er con- er admission conditions and and er the fees that you can er 
POwgd12:892	S3:	 admission 
POwgd12:893	S3:	 the tuition fees 
POwgd12:894	S1:	 yeah true 
POwgd12:895	S12:	 et cetera et cetera 
POwgd12:896	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:897	S1:	 okay so so what we have i'm i'm just going to repeat this er probably er ad nauseam but just so that we are all clear erm we've got our letter of intent we've got the organization of the consortium and the setting up of that consortium as as an entity we we've got the funding issue coming into play then so as need in clarification we've then got the definition of the type of degree and then we're talking about how people need to sit down and clarify the academic content and the structure and that would include issues as to erm the the movement the mobility of students erm i- in 
POwgd12:898	S5:	 this includes many issues i mean the the the academic er proposal 
POwgd12:899	S10:	 @@@
POwgd12:900	S1:	 i 
POwgd12:901	S5:	 it's er has to do with er the assessment it has to do with the 
POwgd12:902	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:903	S5:	 er who is gonna to be eligible to apply it has to do er 
POwgd12:904	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:905	S1:	 but if you 
POwgd12:906	S5:	 the courses offered 
POwgd12:907	S3:	 genau 
POwgd12:908	S1:	 tha- 
POwgd12:909	S5:	 the 
POwgd12:910	S1:	 that's true but if you tease it out in terms of you know what comes first and wh- what then follows on as a result of that erm 
POwgd12:911	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:912	S1:	 you you you need the academic erm content and structure to be defined and i i think 
POwgd12:913	S2:	 we do 
POwgd12:914	S8:	 i think it's the academic issues that 
POwgd12:915	SX-8:	 yeah 
POwgd12:916	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:917	S8:	 the others are discussing 
POwgd12:918	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:919	SX-2:	 the ac- it's clear the academic issues you will do what second term 
POwgd12:920	S7:	 yes 
POwgd12:921	S1:	 so 
POwgd12:922	S5:	 so now we have a you know 
POwgd12:923	S3:	 yes 
POwgd12:924	S1:	 so now now we know what what type of degree is is proposed we know erm the the structure of it in terms of what's going to be taught where erm so that means we know a little bit about how students will will move between the universities erm when do we get then to i'm talking about admission and erm you know evaluation of of entry requirements 
POwgd12:925	S8:	 oh we have to talk about academic terms sh- er should maybe become 
POwgd12:926	S1:	 that's actually yes still a question of yes 
POwgd12:927	S8:	 with the the the er 
POwgd12:928	S1:	 yes as we were mean- mentioning before 
POwgd12:929	S8:	 okay 
POwgd12:930	S1:	 universities even within a country universities can have different starting times and finishing times and examination times 
POwgd12:931	S12:	 oh yes oh yes 
POwgd12:932	S1:	 and these can be nightmares too so if it may be that once we decide on the academic content and structure we should then be thinking in terms of the 
POwgd12:933	S5:	 yes 
POwgd12:934	S6:	 well you can't actually do the structure without knowing the issues of the academic year of your partners so it's part of that 
POwgd12:935	S1:	 no you can't 
POwgd12:936	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:937	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:938	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:939	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:940	S1:	 so it's part of that 
POwgd12:941	S5:	 it's 
POwgd12:942	S1:	 okay and it may well be to that you know that will set s- se- that will be set as a parameter initially anyway in terms of who can collaborate and is is there any way that we could see er of getting around that in er 
POwgd12:943	S12:	 well if if you work on a semester basis or or a trimester basis er then then you can of course arrange 
POwgd12:944	S3:	 no i think because it's your model 
POwgd12:945	S6:	 mhm you can yeah 
POwgd12:946	S9:	 i think this is 
POwgd12:947	S12:	 er 
POwgd12:948	S6:	 i- it's your model [S12] of deciding you wanna do something and then finding a way 
POwgd12:949	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:950	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:951	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:952	S6:	 see what the obstacles are 
POwgd12:953	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:954	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:955	S6:	 it has to be done 
POwgd12:956	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:957	S12:	 it has to be clear 
POwgd12:958	S6:	 and you have to as you said you have to compromise 
POwgd12:959	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:960	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:961	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:962	S6:	 give a bit here and there 
POwgd12:963	S12:	 the starting the- they might really be a very difficult issue if if if of course your academic calendar is is too different but er 
POwgd12:964	S6:	 x some some of our failed attempts to set up joint degrees have failed because of issues of starting 
POwgd12:965	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:966	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:967	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:968	S6:	 xxxxxxxx 
POwgd12:969	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:970	S12:	 yeah it proves to be a very hard one @
POwgd12:971	S1:	 yes and that goes back to the fact that we were saying that so much of this is based on a lot of discussion prior to setting up the consortium i mean the- there there's one thing i'm er a bit concerned about erm and and it's not really critical to this discussion which is that many of our postgraduate courses are are master's courses are taught masters which are intensive one year programs 
POwgd12:972	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd12:973	S1:	 whereas the european model is obviously going to be two years 
POwgd12:974	S3:	 two years 
POwgd12:975	S2:	 two years yeah 
POwgd12:976	S3:	 erm 
POwgd12:977	S6:	 ca- can i just comment that er can i i don't wanna waste time 
POwgd12:978	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:979	S6:	 a a very quick general comment i'm i am really surprised that there's s- such an enormous focus here on joint masters 
POwgd12:980	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:981	S6:	 which are obviously terribly interesting 
POwgd12:982	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:983	S6:	 and very good things to do but there are hundreds of other problems 
POwgd12:984	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:985	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:986	S6:	 in the master's area 
POwgd12:987	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:988	S6:	 of of which this length thing is one hh i because it's so important i'm actually collecting material on master's programs 
POwgd12:989	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:990	S6:	 across europe t- really to advise my colleagues working in this position 
POwgd12:991	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:992	S6:	 and i don't think it's working out as a simple two-year 
POwgd12:993	S12:	 no no no no 
POwgd12:994	S6:	 it's much more complicated 
POwgd12:995	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:996	S6:	 so some places have built into their legislation a two-year model 
POwgd12:997	SX-f:	
POwgd12:998	S6:	 but m- many of x master of the master and all of that 
POwgd12:999	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1000	S6:	 many other places hh have either a one-year model and something else hhh or options which mix the two 
POwgd12:1001	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1002	S6:	 and so on 
POwgd12:1003	S12:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1004	S6:	 i i hope i'll finish this early in the new year xxx 
POwgd12:1005	S12:	 it's not as general as we think it is 
POwgd12:1006	S1:	 okay that would be yes okay so okay 
POwgd12:1007	S6:	 i- it's very mixed 
POwgd12:1008	S1:	 all right 
POwgd12:1009	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1010	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1011	S12:	 completely agree with you 
POwgd12:1012	S1:	 so so going back to where we're at at the moment we've erm defined the type of degree we've talked to we we've mentioned that the academic content and structure needs to be clarified we've then er er and we pulled in the fact that complimentary with this and side by side is the erm the need for the academic terms of a semester whatever erm er procedures used to be erm to be clear and clarified erm where do we go then from that we have about er fifteen minutes left for a discussion and we just don't want @@
POwgd12:1013	S2:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1014	S1:	 what four @@@
POwgd12:1015	S8:	 the- do you think we can talk about admission proced- procedures and creating new systems
POwgd12:1016	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1017	S3:	 well the points you have on the academic issues is you have checked different backgrounds curriculum structure mobility and language policy and i think then comes again all kind of administration questions admission 
POwgd12:1018	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1019	S3:	 selection of students 
POwgd12:1020	S9:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:1021	S10:	 language 
POwgd12:1022	S1:	 i mean i- i think that 
POwgd12:1023	S9:	 what what i want 
POwgd12:1024	S1:	 yes i think admission is critical and and just looking at at the points that were here before point number five was done is organization of teaching but that that pulls into what we were just talking about here 
POwgd12:1025	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1026	SX-f:	
POwgd12:1027	S3:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1028	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1029	S1:	 the academic content and and and structure erm so if we w- we make our new point number five following on from that then admission er procedures wou- would everybody be in agreement with that or do they think there's another element that needs to fit into er this this framework before we move on to admissions 
POwgd12:1030	S6:	 well you can do admission criteria then you have to do assessment 
POwgd12:1031	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1032	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1033	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1034	S1:	 i think so yes 
POwgd12:1035	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1036	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1037	S5:	 an- and of course organization of mobility after the 
POwgd12:1038	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1039	S5:	 admission all kind of organization 
POwgd12:1040	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1041	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1042	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1043	S5:	 but we need to know also the processes that er i've explained before i mean we need to specify what are the internal processes 
POwgd12:1044	S1:	 yes i go- 
POwgd12:1045	S5:	 are and 
POwgd12:1046	S1:	 i got that mentioned as as i mean that w- that was something that means to 
POwgd12:1047	S12:	 generally the admission procedures xxxxx descending xxxxx 
POwgd12:1048	S5:	 and who's in charge of what whether on- it's the international office or is it the 
POwgd12:1049	S1:	 i think though that erm 
POwgd12:1050	S5:	 er 
POwgd12:1051	S5:	 students' office er it's who is who does what
POwgd12:1052	S1:	 but that part of that will be clarified erm with setting up of the consortium 
POwgd12:1053	S12:	 consortium yeah 
POwgd12:1054	S1:	 erm right right at the very first stage 
POwgd12:1055	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1056	S1:	 i think it'll be that will be defined as to er first of all it'll be defined who's taking among the universities who is taking responsibility for various things and then int- internally within the universities it has to be clear erm what what erm department or what erm administrative unit 
POwgd12:1057	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1058	S1:	 is is handing these these kind of things so i think that that would fit in there [S5] 
POwgd12:1059	S5:	 okay 
POwgd12:1060	S1:	 erm what what isn't clear within the structure is the other point you made which is that hh there are erm also internal to each u- university there will be er need for various approval mechanisms 
POwgd12:1061	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1062	S1:	 that we put in place at certain stages and i'm not sure whether 
POwgd12:1063	S6:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1064	S1:	 erm should we just signal this or erm because that that also could depend on individual universities so i i i don't think you can actually fit that into this particular time frame 
POwgd12:1065	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1066	S6:	 yeah an- and also with so yes i i agree you should signal it but we can't necessarily build in it one point because 
POwgd12:1067	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1068	S6:	 the time frame will normally be determined by the meetings schedule 
POwgd12:1069	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1070	S6:	 of the individual university and it could last of course a minor 
POwgd12:1071	S2:	 hm 
POwgd12:1072	S1:	 yes it could yes 
POwgd12:1073	S6:	 x it's a whole lot 
POwgd12:1074	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1075	S6:	 that's just the way it is 
POwgd12:1076	S1:	 yes i think so 
POwgd12:1077	S6:	 so you have to run it concurrently with other things and er 
POwgd12:1078	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1079	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1080	S6:	 you can always but it depends on your institution to use chairman of action to hurry up a few things but 
POwgd12:1081	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1082	S6:	 probably in some institutions you can't 
POwgd12:1083	S1:	 no yes yes tha- tha- that's true so so we signal that [S5] if you like 
POwgd12:1084	S5:	 okay 
POwgd12:1085	S1:	 and so so we're on to admissions criteria erm and do we need to worry erm within this group about who's er taking the lead or do we just assume that each university will will will tackle this i mean should we be seeking that they at this stage erm come to an agreement or should we just be saying that within a consortium each university trusts the other university to select 
POwgd12:1086	S2:	 i think it's better 
POwgd12:1087	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1088	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1089	S2:	 each university select their students 
POwgd12:1090	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1091	S1:	 mhm it i- i- it may be that that of course that will be determined by the type of degree erm 
POwgd12:1092	S5:	 if it's possible 
POwgd12:1093	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1094	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1095	S1:	 that in different cases it may be that you leave it open to each university to admit their own students 
POwgd12:1096	S3:	 the degree 
POwgd12:1097	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1098	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1099	S1:	 or in other cases y- you have an agreed 
POwgd12:1100	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1101	S1:	 set of of entry requirements 
POwgd12:1102	S12:	 th- th- the real problem is there that you w- we are talking about our own students which is a concept that is going to disappear 
POwgd12:1103	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1104	S12:	 because 
POwgd12:1105	S2:	 europeans 
POwgd12:1106	S12:	 after the bachelor 
POwgd12:1107	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1108	S12:	 you don't have your own students any more from the candidature to the xx or or or the the former er type of degrees were what we called i don't know the word in english doorstroom 
POwgd12:1109	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1110	S12:	 huh so so it- it's just going from one stage to another within the same institution 
POwgd12:1111	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1112	S12:	 of course the more we go to europe the less we have this kind of er @ @ let's say guaranteed er movement of the students so 
POwgd12:1113	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1114	S12:	 after the obtaining their bachelor degree they are not your students any more so they can 
POwgd12:1115	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1116	S12:	 orient themselves towards other institutions so 
POwgd12:1117	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1118	S12:	 that's that's the problem of talking about our students 
POwgd12:1119	S8:	 yeah but 
POwgd12:1120	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1121	S8:	 your stud- your students are the one who come to register 
POwgd12:1122	SX-f:	 but they come 
POwgd12:1123	S1:	 yes er they do 
POwgd12:1124	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1125	S8:	 in your university 
POwgd12:1126	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1127	S10:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1128	S8:	 it's the same for xxx 
POwgd12:1129	S10:	 in this way 
POwgd12:1130	S12:	 yeah yeah but they can come from a partner country 
POwgd12:1131	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1132	S10:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1133	SX-f:	 oh 
POwgd12:1134	SX-3:	 oh yeah 
POwgd12:1135	S2:	 of course of course 
POwgd12:1136	SX-f:	 of course of course 
POwgd12:1137	S10:	 anyway they are european students 
POwgd12:1138	S8:	 xxxx xxx they come they come and register xxx 
POwgd12:1139	S2:	 er not belgium or not italian er students that are enrolled in your universities is our students 
POwgd12:1140	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1141	S10:	 voila 
POwgd12:1142	S1:	 okay erm w- we have okay le- let's just leave park admissions criteria as being the next stage erm and and and you were saying erm was it you [S6] who said that evaluation then comes into it so evaluation and er 
POwgd12:1143	S6:	 yes 
POwgd12:1144	S1:	 er grading systems evaluation examinations whatever they all need to be tackled i would think next 
POwgd12:1145	S7:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1146	S1:	 okay er 
POwgd12:1147	S6:	 you have to do housing somewhere so 
POwgd12:1148	S1:	 i think support structure 
POwgd12:1149	S2:	 housing is terrible 
POwgd12:1150	S12:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1151	SS:	 xxx 
POwgd12:1152	S2:	 housing is the crucial thing 
POwgd12:1153	S12:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1154	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1155	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1156	S1:	 how how about if we i mean housing is critical i agree 
POwgd12:1157	S12:	 is terrible 
POwgd12:1158	S1:	 instead of just picking it out as the next thing just have support structures you know so student support s- structures 
POwgd12:1159	S5:	 yeah it's organization of mobility 
POwgd12:1160	S1:	 yes yes yes yes 
POwgd12:1161	S5:	 it's under that 
POwgd12:1162	S12:	 no it's not 
POwgd12:1163	S1:	 yes and and bring out housing as 
POwgd12:1164	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1165	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1166	S1:	 as essential within that 
POwgd12:1167	S12:	 i i i 
POwgd12:1168	S2:	 no housing is critical 
POwgd12:1169	S12:	 i- i- in most universities it's the task of the erasmus socrates people because they are 
POwgd12:1170	S2:	 they can help 
POwgd12:1171	S12:	 they can help 
POwgd12:1172	S2:	 not help just help them 
POwgd12:1173	S12:	 so but it's it's perhaps important that they are involved at a certain moment in time because they have access to the 
POwgd12:1174	S2:	 yes 
POwgd12:1175	S10:	 bei uns waere es der [org3] 
POwgd12:1176	S2:	 yes 
POwgd12:1177	S2:	 they can help to say 
POwgd12:1178	S2:	 no 
POwgd12:1179	S12:	 the data for housing 
POwgd12:1180	S3:	 sometimes a li- a list a list of house on the website a list of addresses but no more 
POwgd12:1181	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1182	S12:	 or even professors taking in students or things like that 
POwgd12:1183	S2:	 @@@@@
POwgd12:1184	S3:	 okay 
POwgd12:1185	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1186	S1:	 er yes we i m- i mean that all comes back too that that accommodation is you come back as we said yesterday it's much easier if 
POwgd12:1187	S12:	 but you are not sure to f- found find a house 
POwgd12:1188	S1:	 people are going for a specific semester at least 
POwgd12:1189	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1190	S1:	 you know if they're going for a few weeks that that can be much more difficult 
POwgd12:1191	S12:	 oh yes 
POwgd12:1192	S1:	 erm so were we've got erm i think about nine more minutes erm we're doing okay at the moment w- we let's let's go on then to the next erm issues that they've mentioned here i think the whole question for example they've picked out e c t s as a separate element 
POwgd12:1193	SX-10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1194	S1:	 that's that really should fit in 
POwgd12:1195	S12:	 no 
POwgd12:1196	S3:	 nowadays 
POwgd12:1197	S12:	 it should fit in 
POwgd12:1198	S3:	 e c t s is compulsory is 
POwgd12:1199	S1:	 yeah i think so 
POwgd12:1200	S12:	 it's a non-issue i think for x 
POwgd12:1201	S2:	 a non-issue yeah 
POwgd12:1202	S10:	 genau genau 
POwgd12:1203	S2:	 do you 
POwgd12:1204	S1:	 no well 
POwgd12:1205	SX-f:	 is it er 
POwgd12:1206	S2:	 do you have do you deliver a diploma supplement 
POwgd12:1207	S1:	 it's not it's 
POwgd12:1208	S12:	 yes 
POwgd12:1209	S1:	 not a non-issue in the 
POwgd12:1210	S12:	 no
POwgd12:1211	S1:	 in the @@@
POwgd12:1212	SS:	 no for the 
POwgd12:1213	S12:	 not so relevant 
POwgd12:1214	S8:	 it's not er 
POwgd12:1215	S1:	 it's but i think 
POwgd12:1216	S12:	 it should not be an issue in the future @@@
POwgd12:1217	S1:	 but i think it should go under erm where we were talking about grading evaluation methods and so on i think we should er bring in the e c the allocation of e c t s er credits there 
POwgd12:1218	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1219	S1:	 erm i think that would make sense erm we've got mobility support structures then erm 
POwgd12:1220	SX-f:	 contracts 
POwgd12:1221	SX-f:	 q a 
POwgd12:1222	S1:	 q a is the the one that's 
POwgd12:1223	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1224	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1225	S2:	 yeah that's very important q a 
POwgd12:1226	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1227	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1228	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1229	S12:	 i think this is going to be different following from the type of er the hh erm cooperation that you have if you have we could think of erm like they do in other services in in in the commercial area like in banking if you have a er a lead in your consortium a quality assurance by the lead partner can be sufficient in order to get they accept it in in the other countries 
POwgd12:1230	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1231	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1232	S12:	 of course if you are in a real let's say er more like yeah equal type of er then then you need quality assurance in each country 
POwgd12:1233	S1:	 erm i'm i'm not so sure er because i wasn't at that previous discussion erm can anybody explain the context in which q a was brought in here is it just that people need to be reassured that there will be some kind of 
POwgd12:1234	S12:	 control 
POwgd12:1235	S1:	 external control or erm i mean i would have thought that er i- in terms of a a decision within a a group of universities to work together on something like this that they would already have er you know they would know erm sometimes intuitary -tuitively sometimes through erm actual knowledge that there are quality assurance mechanisms in place erm and that that some of that discussion would have taken place in relation to the establishment of the consortium but what are we a- actually talking about here 
POwgd12:1236	S6:	 well but there's h- the- there's how there's how you manage it and there's how you present it 
POwgd12:1237	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1238	S6:	 erm and presentation is very important because q a is such a major political issue 
POwgd12:1239	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1240	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1241	S6:	 so not only ministers meeting in bologna hammer on and on and on and unit it but european commission hammers on and on and on about it so you have to present things in a way to make it look that you've thought about it 
POwgd12:1242	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1243	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1244	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1245	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1246	S1:	 right 
POwgd12:1247	S6:	 so that's that erm certainly in the case of my institution it is the administrative division that organizes all 
POwgd12:1248	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1249	S6:	 internal 
POwgd12:1250	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1251	S6:	 quality assurance 
POwgd12:1252	S12:	 quality 
POwgd12:1253	S12:	 yes 
POwgd12:1254	S6:	 checks and that arranges for and makes the arrangements for external 
POwgd12:1255	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1256	S6:	 check-ups 
POwgd12:1257	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1258	S6:	 that come in so i- it's strongly administrative aspect 
POwgd12:1259	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1260	S12:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1261	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1262	S12:	 but in the end if if in belgium you would be the lead partner 
POwgd12:1263	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1264	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1265	S12:	 er that enables you tha- it you don't even have to be the lead partner if you if you register students 
POwgd12:1266	S1:	 hm 
POwgd12:1267	S12:	 you have to be in the end accredited 
POwgd12:1268	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1269	S12:	 for the type of master 
POwgd12:1270	S1:	 that that's that's that's really 
POwgd12:1271	S12:	 and so 
POwgd12:1272	S1:	 what i'm coming back to which is erm we've now reached we we have seven points and we're now talking about q a i would have thought that q a was central to the question of setting up the consortium in the first place you know so that it it should be back at the beginning somewhere 
POwgd12:1273	S6:	 no cos that gives us the more problems 
POwgd12:1274	S12:	 hh 
POwgd12:1275	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1276	SS:	 xxxx 
POwgd12:1277	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1278	S1:	 all right okay 
POwgd12:1279	SX-f:	 a the thing 
POwgd12:1280	S6:	 pra- pra- pragmatically i mean another project if you remember the erasmus mundus gigantic questionnaire that we had a whole huge section on the q a 
POwgd12:1281	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1282	S6:	 arrangements 
POwgd12:1283	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1284	S6:	 which the consortium 
POwgd12:1285	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1286	S6:	 had named and and our international help in addition to all the institutional checks 
POwgd12:1287	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1288	S6:	 helped developed this gigantic 
POwgd12:1289	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1290	S6:	 consortium q a xxx of going round and checking each other 
POwgd12:1291	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1292	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1293	S6:	 sitting in on each other's courses and classes 
POwgd12:1294	S1:	 right 
POwgd12:1295	S6:	 and making sure they were er re- reaching thee objectives 
POwgd12:1296	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1297	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1298	S6:	 et cetera 
POwgd12:1299	S1:	 yeah no tha- that's sounds obviously that that's what's intended here but are we right in assuming it comes at the end of of all the other things xx 
POwgd12:1300	S6:	 i think so cos i think you ha- yo- you work out your q a mechanism once you know precisely 
POwgd12:1301	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1302	S12:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1303	S1:	 all right 
POwgd12:1304	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1305	S1:	 so that looks fine okay 
POwgd12:1306	S12:	 it depends on the formula you've choosen 
POwgd12:1307	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1308	S12:	 er you've chosen for 
POwgd12:1309	S1:	 okay so is everybody happy about that that we put in 
POwgd12:1310	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1311	S1:	 the definition of a q a q a mechanism there 
POwgd12:1312	S12:	
POwgd12:1313	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1314	S1:	 erm having defined some other things beforehand and does that mean that we've covered all our points now 
POwgd12:1315	S6:	 then will be the contract 
POwgd12:1316	S9:	 contracts 
POwgd12:1317	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1318	S5:	 then we need a contracts and area of marketing 
POwgd12:1319	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1320	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1321	S1:	 and what when we say then we do the contract this is the contract to wh- 
POwgd12:1322	S12:	 between partners 
POwgd12:1323	S3:	 between the parties 
POwgd12:1324	SX-f:	 between partners 
POwgd12:1325	S12:	 between partners 
POwgd12:1326	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1327	S8:	 between partners 
POwgd12:1328	S3:	 yes 
POwgd12:1329	S1:	 er at which stage you then get the er is that the stage at which you would you would suggest 
POwgd12:1330	S2:	 er er a [org1] 
POwgd12:1331	S12:	 and then 
POwgd12:1332	S1:	 that the various presidents become involved 
POwgd12:1333	S2:	 er [org1] contract 
POwgd12:1334	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1335	S3:	 yes 
POwgd12:1336	S12:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because once you have a contract you you have to get it through your 
POwgd12:1337	S1:	 @@@@
POwgd12:1338	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1339	S12:	 council xxx y- your your 
POwgd12:1340	SX-3:	 but before that you need the concrete financial plan 
POwgd12:1341	S1:	 yes yes 
POwgd12:1342	S12:	 oh yes yes yes 
POwgd12:1343	SX-3:	 cos otherwise the rector wouldn't sign 
POwgd12:1344	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1345	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1346	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1347	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1348	S10:	 but this cannot be a real problem 
POwgd12:1349	S6:	 so i think you're quite right we we haven't we should we didn't mention it earlier 
POwgd12:1350	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1351	S6:	 but we you have to put that in after academic xx structure 
POwgd12:1352	S5:	 after 
POwgd12:1353	S3:	 after academic yeah yeah 
POwgd12:1354	S6:	 you need the business plan 
POwgd12:1355	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1356	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1357	S2:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1358	S12:	 because you have to approve of the contents also in the council 
POwgd12:1359	S1:	 say that again [S6] i didn't 
POwgd12:1360	S6:	 put put the business plan in 
POwgd12:1361	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1362	S6:	 after but just before admissions criteria 
POwgd12:1363	S1:	 yes 
POwgd12:1364	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1365	S6:	 after academic content and structure 
POwgd12:1366	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1367	S1:	 okay 
POwgd12:1368	S3:	 xxx to discuss the tuition fees or not how high or low 
POwgd12:1369	S10:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1370	S1:	 erm yeah well yes er going back to [S5]'s suggestion at the beginning which is that erm there'll be she suggested that we have erm this particular list of issues did not include the question of marketing and advertising 
POwgd12:1371	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1372	S1:	 i would imagine erm that that comes then at the end of the discussion about that after everything is yes 
POwgd12:1373	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1374	SS:	 xxx 
POwgd12:1375	S12:	 it means that you have to start at least two years on beforehand 
POwgd12:1376	S2:	 before 
POwgd12:1377	SS:	 @@@@@ @@@@@ @@
POwgd12:1378	S1:	 yeah well i mean that's that's actually the final question 
POwgd12:1379	S2:	 one year at least 
POwgd12:1380	S1:	 one year at least 
POwgd12:1381	S12:	 well if if you take it to account the time line for marketing yeah
POwgd12:1382	S8:	 how long 
POwgd12:1383	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1384	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1385	S12:	 then you knew it to be ready in in the winter before you get 
POwgd12:1386	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1387	S12:	 your program going 
POwgd12:1388	S10:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1389	S1:	 yes wh- what what would be our s- our our advice er because that's one of the questions that [first name1] asked us to look at which is to try and give an overall assessment as to the amount of time needed for all of this 
POwgd12:1390	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1391	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1392	S1:	 and he was even going further which was to refine it by going within those elements i don't think we've time to do that 
POwgd12:1393	SX-f:	 a one year 
POwgd12:1394	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1395	S1:	 but if we could give a suggestion as to how much time we think what's the average
POwgd12:1396	S12:	 one year 
POwgd12:1397	SX-f:	 two no two years 
POwgd12:1398	S2:	 starts from 
POwgd12:1399	S12:	 two years is the 
POwgd12:1400	S2:	 no 
POwgd12:1401	S12:	 starts from the end let's say that you want to start in september two thousand and five 
POwgd12:1402	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd12:1403	S12:	 then your marketing has to start at the very last in 
POwgd12:1404	S5:	 december 
POwgd12:1405	S12:	 march 
POwgd12:1406	S3:	 yeah it will take too long xxx 
POwgd12:1407	S12:	 er to of the same year so and then you can go back i i think you need at least two years 
POwgd12:1408	S1:	 i think two years yes would be what i would suggest 
POwgd12:1409	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd12:1410	S9:	 to start 
POwgd12:1411	S3:	 you must convin- consider the internal accreditation process
