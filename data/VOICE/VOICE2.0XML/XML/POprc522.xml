            <note xml:id="POprc522_tn_0">This press conference deals with the conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah in Lebanon and the European Union's approval of a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at ending this conflict. After a meeting of EU foreign ministers, three representatives of the European Commission (S2, S3, S4) report on the meeting's outcome and answer related questions posed by international journalists. Some of these questions are asked and answered in French, and simultaneously translated into English. S1 chairs the press conference and invites journalists in the audience to pose their questions. </note>

<pause/> er er with us er the secretary general decided to postpone the meeting <emph> until </emph> we have had our <pause/> hh own meeting here today <pause/> hh and it think that was er e<c
