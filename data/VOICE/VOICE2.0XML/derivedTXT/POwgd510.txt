POwgd510:32	S5:	 yes 
POwgd510:33	SX-f:	 yes 
POwgd510:34	S5:	 so first thing i c- i think about is erm with creation of certain importance what would be a common ground erm between 
POwgd510:35	SX-f:	 youth and erm n g os 
POwgd510:36	S5:	 youth yeah youth erm i think about xx x but yeah youth n g os and the whole political process it's it's a bit vague i mean what do we mean by political process but yeah cos through that erm common ground bodies er that's i've opened doors for young people through y- youth n g os on equal er equally representative basis erm discriminative basis as proper xxx anyway er er but erm er @ on the other side of the dialogue the political the the legislative xx x x recipients of er youth participation on a national level i suppose 
POwgd510:37	S3:	 mhm but anyway just xx about the questions erm the question is x x x us as n g os what can we do 
POwgd510:38	SX-f:	 youth 
POwgd510:39	S3:	 to assure our own 
POwgd510:40	SX-8:	 to be assured x xx

POwgd510:43	SX-8:	 yeah 
POwgd510:44	SX-m:	 xx 
POwgd510:45	S6:	 can i just say x x on the the steps of the erm dec- er decision-making process so the steps who x x x xx and then we can decide so we can be assured to be x but i mean our xxx interpretation of decision-making process 
POwgd510:46	SX-m:	 it's fine x x 
POwgd510:47	SX-8:	 yeah yes 
POwgd510:48	S6:	 er so def- define what's the decision-making pro- xxxx like parliament 
POwgd510:49	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd510:50	S6:	 erm i mean just 
POwgd510:51	SX-m:	 hm 
POwgd510:52	SX-6:	 erm what would the decision-making process x x x x 
POwgd510:53	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd510:54	SS:	 x x x x x x x x 
POwgd510:55	S5:	 yeah er what's for me in er europe i believe or the west in general it's no in xx x er i think it's er the legislative and the executive power 
POwgd510:56	S3:	 er for for asia it's basically the x the policy decis- or decision-making it's usually done by the government 
POwgd510:57	SX-6:	 no i mean the process of of the x structure process 
POwgd510:58	S3:	 the process the process 
POwgd510:59	SX-f:	 the actual process 
POwgd510:60	S6:	 mhm so it's like the parliament 
POwgd510:61	S5:	 they draft the legislation going through er the committees or thematic committees 
POwgd510:62	S3:	 i guess in the part where we can share that on our part is basically how do you reach x the n g os engage the students or the young people themselves in erm in er in s- in policies making them aware of the policies and erm what are the positive and the negative side er how can they maximize the positive side er what are the different ways it could be dialogue making dialogues with the government or civil agencies erm because in our experience the tendencies for government xx the tendencies for governments in our asian pacific experiences they don't listen until you engage with them 
POwgd510:63	SX-5:	 yeah but i mean because it is now have to be engaged x x x x and it's nothing i mean i think parliament x x x 
POwgd510:64	S3:	 well i'm talking i i'm talking about basically just the government 
POwgd510:65	SX-5:	 xx x x x x x 
POwgd510:66	SX-5:	 ah 
POwgd510:67	S3:	 i'm i'm dealing with the government whether it's the the ministry in education whether it's it's in the legislation 
POwgd510:68	S5:	 hm 
POwgd510:69	S5:	 yes of course for us at [place0] er the the best er would be to be engaged in the last er s- phase of er decision-making
POwgd510:70	S8:	 yeah 
POwgd510:71	S5:	 so i mean erm yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd510:72	S8:	 so when you talk when you talk x x x x it's x to start x x x x and and then x x engage x x x x x 
POwgd510:73	S5:	 exact and what the e u does er if er i don't know if you any anyone is aware this er public consultation er with er state xx n g os on s- erm when when when the e u is about to legislate but but it's not the very beginning of the of the decision-making process so i'm just saying 
POwgd510:74	SX-f:	 hm 
POwgd510:75	S6:	 yeah so the beginning decision-making process is the consultation 
POwgd510:76	S5:	 co- 
POwgd510:77	S5:	 s- er well the e u does that 
POwgd510:78	S6:	 x x x x and then er 
POwgd510:79	S5:	 i like it xxx because we'll show you what is going to be the policy then you have a say on it as a consulting party 
POwgd510:80	SX-f:	 xx 
POwgd510:81	S3:	 are we going to it then like 
POwgd510:82	S5:	 yeah i i i prefer if if we just make the steps and then go

POwgd510:84	S5:	 step by step 
POwgd510:85	S3:	 ah i i'm just thinking it's more like x x x x all the a c s storing all x x x xxx because if we go to that it may be difficult s- some of us may not be really engaged

POwgd510:134	SX-8:	 mhm 
POwgd510:135	S5:	 er maybe common bodies you get participation of of young people er but they should be ad hoc i mean on on a specific initiative of the government it could call such bodies up to to listen to young people but of course we are aiming for erm substantial youth participation and i just can't s- see 
POwgd510:136	S3:	 [S7] er maybe you can elaborate on that how do you ensure democratic spaces 
POwgd510:137	S7:	 yeah it's er some kind of erm

POwgd510:139	S7:	 you need er democ- democracy can only be be built if er people participate and vice versa so er you need to to gain this this er er this space of participation er that's why i to- i i i'm telling that er if there is no democratic process people will not be able to participate x so that's one of the most important things is to assure basic level of erm er allowance to participate otherwise you'll not have for instance er if you if you look all over the world you not you don't have the same level of participation for women as you have for men so that's one of the most er serious thing er you don't have a house of the ma- the s- the same the same er er level of opportunity of er er most development most developx countries er when you compare to er developing countries er so

POwgd510:352	SX:	 @ @ @ @
POwgd510:353	S9:	 actually i could share erm a concrete tool that we've used in kosovo is er to have simulation er it's actually a non-formal education project simulating er democratic structures for example we have er one project which has been running for several years which is the youth assemblies in different municipalities so it's it's youth that that function as an assembly they discuss things at the municipal assembly discusses but it's for them it's an educational project so they they simulate in order to learn about how an assembly works but in fact it's it's it's grown in in cer- er to an extent that now these youth assemblies have become also a voice for the youth 
POwgd510:354	SX-5:	 mhm 
POwgd510:355	S9:	 because the the municipal youth assembly listens to them and when they want to know these opinion they could xx assembly but these are youth between fifteen and eighteen years old so they're very young but they they and they really become familiar abou- er with democratic structures 
POwgd510:356	S7:	 erm if i can add er in portugal we have already some er that's i i'm sure that happens in several other countries for instance in scotland it's happening x x and one project up there in germany too and in kongo i know that there are some projects too x x where all the young people between a certain er range of age and not x x x x x x situation er from all schools er they vote directly in xxxx in the municipality youth council er this is a- and er the the erm the the average of participation is er enormously compared with erm with regular the voting process with with the regular elections erm for for for instance for er wh- whe- when er when of course those cases are are u- under er the the age to to be able to vote in national elections for instance er but young people er voting are of eighty or more per cent so this is er er a direct act of er er of participation and er creation of democratic process erm so this is one of one example er of what er er we can do we members of n g os we can stimulate also we can x er active politics er being together with the governors er we can we can direct policies toward youth participation in some cases like these one but in there are many others that we can we can approach approach that's one of one of concrete example 
POwgd510:357	S9:	 do we need to write down what we are saying 
POwgd510:358	S5:	 yeah i think we just have to x xx x x x x x x xx x so did you finish about 
POwgd510:359	S3:	 yeah she's she's writing it down she's the rapporteur 
POwgd510:360	SX-8:	 i write it down

POwgd510:366	S5:	 it won't we must sum up right
POwgd510:367	S9:	 yeah 
POwgd510:368	S5:	 yeah so erm x x x has spoke er at first on on the public consultation think erm i think that that that must be a central theme in in n g o er politic of participation er just like the e u does as i mentioned earlier with the public consultations but er er er i think it must be secured maybe maybe public consultation can take place in such youth assemblies but er they must maybe they must be more of an advisory in their role there must be something to xx a veto i don't want to say a veto 
POwgd510:369	S9:	 yeah yeah
POwgd510:370	S9:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd510:371	S5:	 but there must be something that you know it's not just consultation but very new sense 
POwgd510:372	S9:	 yeah 
POwgd510:373	S5:	 erm i don't know how to put it in you know 
POwgd510:374	S9:	 so yo- er er youth representive -tive structure which has a more than a x x x and er and er status 
POwgd510:375	S5:	 yes yes er may- er er when maybe the public consultation can pass through such an assembly 
POwgd510:376	S9:	 yeah 
POwgd510:377	S5:	 which in in which there is a a a a a democratic representation of n g os
POwgd510:378	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd510:379	S5:	 which can yes 
POwgd510:380	S9:	 but yeah 
POwgd510:381	S9:	 actually just to give you the example of kosovo th- we have a draft youth floor which will er establish kosovo youth action councils in every municipalities 
POwgd510:382	S5:	 yes we know 
POwgd510:383	S9:	 so this will be the the the formal structure for the youth these youth assemblies are just a simulation educational project you know 
POwgd510:384	SX-m:	 hm 
POwgd510:385	S9:	 so er but then the kosovo youth action councils will be councils that that the assembly the municipal assemblies have to consult but again it's it's more x x i guess 
POwgd510:386	SX-m:	 aha 
POwgd510:387	S3:	 i guess concretely from the youth assemblies is a possibility of creating erm like a youth action agenda or erm where erm er er these can actually be presented to the government or to the parliament or whatever concern the parties there may be in the respective countries so in that sense this can also be this could also serve as a basis x x x x x still looking at the po- existing policies or policies to be made in and for the youth or with or for the youth 
POwgd510:388	SX-5:	 er yeah 
POwgd510:389	S7:	 x x x measure x x and the exactly to x x x x x x kosovo er is to erm to force to come er to force the government to having the administration councils for instance in the in the erm in the structures with the governmental structures x x x xx xx er they must er they must consider er we've been to for instance x x x to er er power of er youth er structures in er the same level the same er fifty per cent of the decision of the board that will decide if the budget will be approved or not fifty per cent of the decision will depend of youth er s- structures representative structures and the other and the other half will depend of the governmental er members
POwgd510:390	S5:	 this is very good 
POwgd510:391	S7:	 er so this is a way to force to directly force and to negotiate with er with the government and to force them to to xx some some policies that in in other way if they only consult they will never well they will listen but they'll never abide so er before they be able to approve the budget in the parliament they must first have the approvement at at this level at at the administration level which has in our case as er fifty per cent half of it depends on the of the policy of youth in the real co-management process erm this will also xx more responsibility to these structures and can be that it can it ca- this also can be xx for youth n g os if they don't use it x x x if they're not attempted if they don't do their job well erm because er well they can't xx xx er so but the most important thing here the most importa- important idea is that you must create tools to force the governments to listening and to do what you say not only not only to listen 
POwgd510:392	S9:	 erm or the these structures can themselves implement like for example sorry to keep coming back at this but the kosovo youth action councils will be implementing the kosovo youth action plan as a governmental strategy erm that goes together with the youth policy as the implementing mechanism so this means that these kosovo youth action councils will will be partly implementing the governmental plan and they are representative of the civil society
