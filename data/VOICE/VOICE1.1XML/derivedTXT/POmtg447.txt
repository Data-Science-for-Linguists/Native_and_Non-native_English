POmtg447:359	S6:	 so we have to think what do we want 
POmtg447:360	SS:	 yeah 
POmtg447:361	S6:	 because 
POmtg447:362	SX-4:	 yeah 
POmtg447:363	S6:	 er it's completely different from other events or 
POmtg447:364	SX-3:	 yeah 
POmtg447:365	S2:	 we thought that perhaps 
POmtg447:366	S4:	 erm 
POmtg447:367	S2:	 at some point this morning people could have a think now we could decide now you want to do this but we thought because you're going to produce the recipe and w- we're already discovering things like [S6] has just said that 
POmtg447:368	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg447:369	S2:	 you know i- it's that kind of event then we do it this way we were thinking about what's would be your sort of five suggestions that you would want to put in the recipe book so what we thought might do is in 
POmtg447:370	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg447:371	S2:	 perhaps first individually just sit and have a think about your own thoughts so far about what you'd done and then work with the small group 
POmtg447:372	SX-3:	 i would 
POmtg447:373	S2:	 around you 
POmtg447:374	SX-3:	 mhm
POmtg447:375	S2:	 and see if we can come up with some suggestions for hh 
POmtg447:376	SX-3:	 hh 
POmtg447:377	S2:	 you know what you what you wanna do 
POmtg447:378	S3:	 the main 
POmtg447:379	S3:	 yes
POmtg447:380	S2:	 because this recipe book the i don't think you're gonna have much time to talk about today but this is another outcome of the projects and actually i mean this is gonna be enormous @@ i think 
POmtg447:381	SS:	 @@@
POmtg447:382	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg447:383	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg447:384	S2:	 er this and and it can be suggestions about that kind of thing we were talking about or suggestion about hh you know for example you could suggest things about what kind of language learning activities you could do and i thought quiz was fantastic at the end giving everybody that word 
POmtg447:385	SX-3:	 hm 
POmtg447:386	S2:	 and at the end using the prices i thought everyone responded really very well to that 
POmtg447:387	S3:	 hm 
POmtg447:388	S2:	 and you know er people making er connections between dutch and german i think it works very well with languages that have a lot in common 
POmtg447:389	SX-f:	 xx 
POmtg447:390	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg447:391	S2:	 xxx i said to [S6] you could do that with 
POmtg447:392	SS:	 spanish or portuguese 
POmtg447:393	S3:	 yes 
POmtg447:394	S2:	 or you can possibly you could try it in french and spanish or something 
POmtg447:395	S3:	 it 
POmtg447:396	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg447:397	S3:	 it had another great advantage as well from the organizational point of view in that people understood that was the end of the er evening and they left otherwise they would be sitting there eating food for till nine o'clock and they yeah 
POmtg447:398	SX-f:	 this 
POmtg447:399	S2:	 yeah yeah

POmtg447:402	S3:	 hm 
POmtg447:403	S3:	 yes

POmtg447:405	S4:	 xxxxxx 
POmtg447:406	S2:	 and what you suggest in terms of dissemination and publicity 
POmtg447:407	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg447:408	S2:	 maybe so think about those things and er and then you come up with some suggestions
POmtg447:409	S4:	 yeah 
POmtg447:410	S2:	 think what you would say and then 
POmtg447:411	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg447:412	S2:	 what everybody else says erm you know see what we can come up with and then at the end of the whole project i guess whoever's doing the recipe 
POmtg447:413	SX-f:	 no 
POmtg447:414	S2:	 would would would would need to bring it all together
POmtg447:415	S3:	 we can bring it all together 
POmtg447:416	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg447:417	SX-5:	 just need to xx x 
POmtg447:418	S2:	 but there's so much wonderful experience that has come out of everything that we've all heard from each other and then you know now people can say no no okay you know if it's that kind of event as you said you know you 
POmtg447:419	SX-6:	 yeah yes 
POmtg447:420	SX-1:	 yes i agree about that

POmtg447:422	S3:	 yeah 
POmtg447:423	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg447:424	S2:	 i mean one thing thing i felt that was difficult was that you had a dutch dutch speaker and then kept correcting her
