PBmtg3:1303	S1:	 er we got in hello kitty again the response is so far er so good so er we have some er some some er expectations for hello kitty er of course i'll give you more er details of our learning 
PBmtg3:1304	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1305	S1:	 from last year especially the er what we have to er do for year two thousand four 
PBmtg3:1306	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1307	S1:	 but hello kitty was a bit er early to say but it looks like it will be quite successful 
PBmtg3:1308	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1309	S1:	 er character okay 
PBmtg3:1310	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1311	S1:	 of course this er share of business and variation is based on value i'd have some okay the next one will be quite er more analytical over er on our sales result per distribution channel okay so we have here convenience store department store [org30] hypermarket like er [org31] [org32] [org32] is local one and also general trade er bakery shop we do we do not have any er 
PBmtg3:1312	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1313	S1:	 sales outlet and special outlets here er is like er er [org33] [org33] er is the family restaurant owned by [org34] okay so if you look at er c v s there's a er increase from may the sales er increased from er dramatically from april to may and maintained er quite a good number in june july and august then dropped dramatically again from september and october november even december there er is some minus number 
PBmtg3:1314	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1315	S1:	 er it it is as i mentioned er when [first name1] was in korea in march we agreed that we have to do something for the c v s because we thought some opportunity there so we really push so we listed products 
PBmtg3:1316	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1317	S1:	 after couple of months when there's no er uptake occurred the c v s head o- head headquarter asked us to er return er the the collection of return goods so that's why why the number looks quite good for almost four months then all of a sudden the number dropped dramatically from september all the way to the end of 
PBmtg3:1318	S4:	 and that's for sure the packaging with the plastic
PBmtg3:1319	S5:	 i think so xxxxxxxx 
PBmtg3:1320	S4:	 but why would we launch this this 
PBmtg3:1321	S1:	 xxxxx 
PBmtg3:1322	S4:	 this packaging
PBmtg3:1323	S5:	 it was a skin skin wobbler 
PBmtg3:1324	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1325	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1326	S5:	 this one 
PBmtg3:1327	S2:	 yes this one 
PBmtg3:1328	S5:	 and the packaging 
PBmtg3:1329	S2:	 yeah yes your present one yes right 
PBmtg3:1330	S4:	 cos usually for the for the convenience we have that that licensed impulse carton that's why i'm wondering why 
PBmtg3:1331	S5:	 vielleicht war er zu breit 
PBmtg3:1332	S4:	 why why you went with the the plastic tray
PBmtg3:1333	SX-2:	 oh okay 
PBmtg3:1334	S4:	 because this plastic tray usually is not the best packaging since er it's very difficult to merchandise if you take it out you will never 
PBmtg3:1335	S1:	 yeah yeah xxx 
PBmtg3:1336	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg3:1337	S1:	 xxx 
PBmtg3:1338	S4:	 haben wir ueberhaupt noch einen
PBmtg3:1339	S5:	 xxx 
PBmtg3:1340	S4:	 nein xxx 
PBmtg3:1341	S5:	 ich weiss nicht 
PBmtg3:1342	S4:	 we we get one sample of that impulse carton 
PBmtg3:1343	S1:	 well if you go to er c v s there are multi-layers of shelf 
PBmtg3:1344	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1345	S1:	 okay er to put this kind of high display 
PBmtg3:1346	S2:	 xxx 
PBmtg3:1347	S4:	 yeah so is it on hooks in the in the c v s or is it in the in the cartons
PBmtg3:1348	S2:	 it's in shelf but x 
PBmtg3:1349	S4:	 it's lying in the shelf or or 
PBmtg3:1350	S1:	 it's lying on the shelf 
PBmtg3:1351	S2:	 it's lying on the shelf 
PBmtg3:1352	S4:	 aha 
PBmtg3:1353	S1:	 and the shelf height is quite limited 
PBmtg3:1354	S3:	 mhm okay 
PBmtg3:1355	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg3:1356	S1:	 so the best location for this is a top shelf 
PBmtg3:1357	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg3:1358	S1:	 the top shelf is really tough to get
PBmtg3:1359	SX-4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1360	S1:	 we have to com- compete with er the others 
PBmtg3:1361	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1362	S1:	 er where er which also want to that spot to have that spot 
PBmtg3:1363	S3:	 sure sure 
PBmtg3:1364	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1365	S1:	 unless we have some good reference of sales 
PBmtg3:1366	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:1367	S1:	 they don't give that spot to us so many cases cases we end up with a in the middle or or the bottom 
PBmtg3:1368	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1369	S1:	 then this because of the height er we fetch we u- er actually in most cases should be er without 
PBmtg3:1370	S2:	 xxxx 
PBmtg3:1371	S1:	 so that's why we use the plastic er which is er this this low low item 
PBmtg3:1372	S4:	 mhm but again that i understand it right the products are just lying in the shelf they're not hanging on a hook they are just lying in the in the shelf
PBmtg3:1373	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg3:1374	S1:	 xxxx xx 
PBmtg3:1375	S2:	 xxxxxxx xx xxxxxxx 
PBmtg3:1376	S1:	 xxx xx 
PBmtg3:1377	S2:	 this one
PBmtg3:1378	S4:	 aha this one you have 
PBmtg3:1379	S2:	 yes we made er maybe around september or october
PBmtg3:1380	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1381	S1:	 xxxxxxxxx xxx 
PBmtg3:1382	S2:	 xx xxxxx 
PBmtg3:1383	S1:	 here you are on page seventeen 
PBmtg3:1384	S2:	 xxxxx 
PBmtg3:1385	SX-3:	 ah yeah 
PBmtg3:1386	S1:	 er 
PBmtg3:1387	S2:	 xxx xx xxx 
PBmtg3:1388	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1389	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1390	S4:	 and this is the presentation for the convenience stores
PBmtg3:1391	S1:	 er convenience store as well as supermarket 
PBmtg3:1392	S2:	 supermarket 
PBmtg3:1393	S1:	 for multiple purpose 
PBmtg3:1394	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1395	S1:	 we made about three hundred 
PBmtg3:1396	S2:	 there are so we made this er this er er display maybe around oct- maybe october or november
PBmtg3:1397	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1398	S2:	 so we are now starting 
PBmtg3:1399	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg3:1400	S1:	 because we realized that the visibility of this product is really important 
PBmtg3:1401	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:1402	S1:	 and er in many cases the location er the [org1] product is found is er is a mid- middle er mid- m- mid-level of the shelf or the the the low the lowest 
PBmtg3:1403	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1404	S1:	 where the visibility is really where visibility is really er low 
PBmtg3:1405	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:1406	S1:	 and so we decide to make this kind of a special er display 
PBmtg3:1407	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1408	S1:	 so we can er 
PBmtg3:1409	S5:	 it's there 
PBmtg3:1410	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1411	S1:	 you get it
PBmtg3:1412	S2:	 that one 
PBmtg3:1413	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1414	S2:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:1415	S4:	 this one you know 
PBmtg3:1416	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1417	S1:	 yeah yeah so we can er persuade er the er c v s store okay 
PBmtg3:1418	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1419	S5:	 xx xxxxx 
PBmtg3:1420	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1421	S1:	 er the ne- er department store er i just see er there's some peak in april and october and december er we learned that depart- at er for the department store distribution er only the children's day and christmas there's er some peak but o- other than that the sale is just er quite stable and low okay 
PBmtg3:1422	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1423	S1:	 [org30] er during month of may till september there's er almost none because we had to concentrate into c v s okay so the- there was some trade off between c v s and [org30] during the month of may till er august but from november there's er some er sales again er by that time we er concluded that c v s is not a a best er solution for us so we change our er distribution er target 
PBmtg3:1424	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1425	S1:	 more to 
PBmtg3:1426	S1:	 er where also we fight for shelf space 
PBmtg3:1427	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1428	S1:	 but these er local products which is not exactly same concept as er [THING1] but some candies with some er toys 
PBmtg3:1429	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1430	S1:	 selling between five hundred to six hundred korean won 
PBmtg3:1431	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1432	S1:	 whereas our retail price is er fifteen hundred so it's only one third of our price
PBmtg3:1433	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1434	S1:	 so hh we sold a lot with some promotion activities in hypermarket but hypermarket we have to fight with local product with a very er low price
PBmtg3:1435	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1436	S1:	 er general trade xxxx 
PBmtg3:1437	S2:	 xxxxx 
PBmtg3:1438	S1:	 the general trade is the the candy shops 
PBmtg3:1439	S2:	 tra- traditional channel 
PBmtg3:1440	S1:	 traditional channel er a bit looks for sure quite a fluctuation there 
PBmtg3:1441	S4:	 but so far we had in all channels increases right
PBmtg3:1442	S1:	 er 
PBmtg3:1443	S4:	 in total
PBmtg3:1444	S1:	 so er we see some er potentials in hypermarket and general trade okay
PBmtg3:1445	S4:	 yeah but those twelve per cent in c v s does that mean we increased 
PBmtg3:1446	S5:	 twelve 
PBmtg3:1447	S4:	 twelve per cent in c v s
PBmtg3:1448	S1:	 no no that's the er 
PBmtg3:1449	S2:	 general 
PBmtg3:1450	S4:	 oh it's general share 
PBmtg3:1451	S1:	 yeah general business 
PBmtg3:1452	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg3:1453	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg3:1454	S1:	 again er the major contributio- -butor in terms of er value er among our sales outlet are those two so hypermarket and general trade
PBmtg3:1455	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1456	S1:	 with er thirty-seven and thirty-one per cent
PBmtg3:1457	S4:	 general trade er you sell directly to or wholesalers or 
PBmtg3:1458	S2:	 wholesalers 
PBmtg3:1459	S4:	 to er 
PBmtg3:1460	S1:	 wholesalers 
PBmtg3:1461	S2:	 to wholesaler 
PBmtg3:1462	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:1463	S1:	 and it's true that there was some change of our organization er last year er if if er [S5] remembers well er as i er explained to er mister [S4/last] er earlier today that we changed er division manager from mister [last name3] to [first name2] [last name2] [first name2] [last name2] took over er as of september first was that september first of october 
PBmtg3:1464	S2:	 er augu- 
PBmtg3:1465	S1:	 september okay
PBmtg3:1466	S2:	 but in the meantime of er august
PBmtg3:1467	S1:	 yeah he was a product manager er used to be handled by [first name5] 
PBmtg3:1468	S5:	 mhm

PBmtg3:2003	S4:	 i i think they will say no because usually 
PBmtg3:2004	S1:	 they will say no
PBmtg3:2005	S4:	 usually every licenser er giving the approval for a header card for a display wants of course his licence to be on the display then they will never accept i mean we can check with them but they will never accept

PBmtg3:2014	S2:	 hm 
PBmtg3:2015	S4:	 i mean this is this is only a small example i mean if you have seven hundred erm or three hundred how many 
PBmtg3:2016	S2:	 three three 
PBmtg3:2017	S1:	 three hundred we produced three hundred
PBmtg3:2018	S4:	 if you produced three hundred and 
PBmtg3:2019	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:2020	S4:	 you have it in the stores since when since a couple of months 
PBmtg3:2021	S1:	 only er one and a half month
PBmtg3:2022	S2:	 x months 
PBmtg3:2023	S4:	 yeah then i think in that case we should not wake up any any dogs by going now 
PBmtg3:2024	SX-m:	 xx x 
PBmtg3:2025	S4:	 now since it's in the 
PBmtg3:2026	S1:	 okay 
PBmtg3:2027	S4:	 in the trade 
PBmtg3:2028	SX-3:	 yeah 
PBmtg3:2029	S4:	 now to the licenser and ask for permission because if they say no you have to remove everything 
PBmtg3:2030	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:2031	S4:	 i think that's for three hundred displays not not relevant
PBmtg3:2032	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:2033	S4:	 but maybe we can agree in the future whenever 
PBmtg3:2034	S1:	 sure sure 
PBmtg3:2035	S4:	 you put any kind of display so or do anything even if you place and ad in a in a comic magazine and you lo- you y- y- you use the licence everything basically needs to be approved except if it's images of our products i mean if it's the if it's a donald duck dispenser 
PBmtg3:2036	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:2037	S4:	 you show that needs no approval if you if it's a product 
PBmtg3:2038	S1:	 i know 
PBmtg3:2039	S1:	 product is er 
PBmtg3:2040	S4:	 like but but if it's like the the

PBmtg3:2051	S2:	 mhm okay 
PBmtg3:2052	S4:	 the correct way please 
PBmtg3:2053	S1:	 so er that means we better change as soon as possible before any [org40] people see that and initiate some unpleasant er hh power of action against it 
PBmtg3:2054	S4:	 yeah i wou- i would say since according to the figures erm you you should put [org40] characters anyway on there because they're very very successful
PBmtg3:2055	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:2056	S4:	 so i would suggest to put hello kitty on the display 
PBmtg3:2057	S1:	 but er the problem is this [first name8] rack holding

PBmtg3:2059	S1:	 a kitty right

PBmtg3:3988	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:3989	S1:	 xx xx x 
PBmtg3:3990	S3:	 so they're packed with eight candies himself package 
PBmtg3:3991	S5:	 xx xx 
PBmtg3:3992	S3:	 yeah what else 
PBmtg3:3993	S1:	 w- w- we will try in-flight 
PBmtg3:3994	S3:	 there's also the pencil case in the gift line 
PBmtg3:3995	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:3996	S3:	 and inside the pencil case there's a dispenser which comes together with two candies these are in 
PBmtg3:3997	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg3:3998	S3:	 okay in in the back of the catalogue you find all the measurements packaging 
PBmtg3:3999	S1:	 uhu 
PBmtg3:4000	S3:	 for the candies for di- -spensers 
PBmtg3:4001	S4:	 yeah that's especially important when you place the next order that all the dimensions of the packaging material changes because of the switch to to blister
PBmtg3:4002	S2:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg3:4003	S4:	 so you have to consider by planning er the content of the container that the dimensions of the packaging material is now changed they get bigger 
PBmtg3:4004	S1:	 so our importing department have to consider 
PBmtg3:4005	S5:	 increase 
PBmtg3:4006	S1:	 that increased volume 
PBmtg3:4007	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:4008	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:4009	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:4010	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:4011	S1:	 but they may have to er reflect this into volume er in the container 
PBmtg3:4012	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:4013	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:4014	S4:	 so unfortunately the the di- the disadvantage of this packaging is that we transport a lot of air so with it so it makes the volume 
PBmtg3:4015	S1:	 the shipping cost 
PBmtg3:4016	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:4017	SX-3:	 mhm 
PBmtg3:4018	S1:	 we increase no
PBmtg3:4019	S4:	 right 
PBmtg3:4020	S1:	 how much percentage you lose in efficiency you calculated
