EDwsd242:1	S8:	 okay may i have your attention please xx would like to continue with the making of the presentation erm we got a kind of format for this er presentation which i will explain to you now erm unfortunately you are it's er xxx part of this conference that we are doing this all these things step by step and quite regulated and er well this has some advantages and disadvantages erm what's well i would i would ask i would like to ask you to to try as much as possible to follow to follow the steps there will also be some room for more er discussion erm within the well by making the presentation so that's s- maybe er might fulfil the need some people have here to go really deeper into erm the content of our topic erm well what we're going to do now is er we have the presentation and presentation has consists of five er points erm we should do it in one and a half hour er so until five o'clock and 
EDwsd242:2	S2:	 to make it 
EDwsd242:3	S8:	 to make it and the presentation should be er take fifteen minutes and it's made up of four er five er par- five parts a short introduction erm the best case scenar- scena- er best case scenario probable case scenario 
EDwsd242:4	SX-2:	 no the probable case
EDwsd242:5	S8:	 so that's er 
EDwsd242:6	S2:	 oh sorry yeah the best case sorry 
EDwsd242:7	S8:	 yeah that's so that's er an hour for this one number four er you sh- you should say something about that then something about the most likely scenario er which is 
EDwsd242:8	S2:	 it simply said where we where we want to be in the future and where we probably will be those are the two scenarios we have to explain very shortly to the situations
EDwsd242:9	S8:	 and er then we have to come up with the recommendations and that's something we will do on basis of this list the list we made in the last one and a half hours and er we should remember that motivation to your languages and that is our aim for the future erm well we don't do this er not as i- in as a er erm as a whole in the whole group er but we're going to divide the group into subgroups er there will be a er group of approximately six people working out the best case scenario or presenting the best case scenario 
EDwsd242:10	S2:	 and that will be then the scenario that is here the best case this is lego so the group that did lego the scenario lego of co- obviously already presented it so it's their task to do it in three minutes so you have to cut down bring out your scenario with a name and really shortly state what your scenario's about for the audience you can pick one or two persons to do it you don't have to do it with all six of you because i think in three minutes that's not possible
EDwsd242:11	SX-f:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:12	S2:	 so please try to think pragmatic- er 
EDwsd242:13	S8:	 pragmatically
EDwsd242:14	S2:	 yeah pragmatically so 
EDwsd242:15	S8:	 well the same goes for the most likely scenario erm it's also needs to be er condensed in a three minutes er presentation
EDwsd242:16	S9:	 but isn't that the same
EDwsd242:17	S2:	 mhm not o- not on the whole because cosmo europe was hh here cosmo europe a little bit on this with the er eu- europe what is it 
EDwsd242:18	S7:	 neurope 
EDwsd242:19	SX-5:	 neuropa 
EDwsd242:20	S2:	 ye- yah and here is also so i suggest that the cosmo europe group will do the erm the most likely which is kind of er sorry yeah which is kind of a mixture of this and this so where are we heading
EDwsd242:21	S6:	 but can- do you mean ma- make a mixture of four and two because it's either multi- or 
EDwsd242:22	S2:	 yes yes 
EDwsd242:23	S8:	 well 
EDwsd242:24	S6:	 english-only 
EDwsd242:25	S8:	 i- 
EDwsd242:26	S8:	 well if if if people say we would rather prefer the worst case scenario
EDwsd242:27	S2:	 that is also possible 
EDwsd242:28	S8:	 it's also possible
EDwsd242:29	S2:	 to show where we don't want to go and where we do want to go maybe it's more easy
EDwsd242:30	S18:	 that's actually 
EDwsd242:31	S2:	 yeah it's more 
EDwsd242:32	S18:	 actually i think that's better 
EDwsd242:33	S2:	 yeah
EDwsd242:34	S18:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:35	S8:	 okay it's 
EDwsd242:36	S2:	 cos it's more easy to explain the differences as well 
EDwsd242:37	S1:	 but this most likely scenario er how many time 
EDwsd242:38	SX-f:	 yes 
EDwsd242:39	S1:	 erm after now more or less i mean is is maybe five years 
EDwsd242:40	S2:	 ten years
EDwsd242:41	S2:	 ten years
EDwsd242:42	S1:	 ten okay ten 
EDwsd242:43	S2:	 ten o- okay then new 
EDwsd242:44	S18:	 i mean 
EDwsd242:45	S18:	 the worst case scenario ex- excuse me the worst case scenario all of these things are just trends 
EDwsd242:46	SX-14:	 du ich find nicht dass wir besonders 
EDwsd242:47	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:48	S18:	 so it's not this is how it's going to be but this is what we fear where it's going to and you know 
EDwsd242:49	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:50	S18:	 this is what we were discussing all the time we fear this 
EDwsd242:51	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:52	S2:	 hm 
EDwsd242:53	S18:	 hh and i really do and by the by the way no anyway 
EDwsd242:54	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:55	S1:	 xx 
EDwsd242:56	S2:	 okay so then it's everyone agrees upon then that we 
EDwsd242:57	S5:	 so why we 
EDwsd242:58	S2:	 present the best case and the worst case and we the recommendations are then based on where we don't want to go and where we do want to go 
EDwsd242:59	S9:	 yes 
EDwsd242:60	S2:	 okay actually erm 
EDwsd242:61	S18:	 question erm 
EDwsd242:62	S8:	 we're going we going to use the list over there on the xx 
EDwsd242:63	S2:	 this list 
EDwsd242:64	S2:	 without yeah 
EDwsd242:65	S18:	 erm wouldn't would it be rhe- er rhethor- rhetorical better or erm better to to er switch best case and worst case scenario so to have the worst case first and then the best case hh because i mean 
EDwsd242:66	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:67	S2:	 that's a good 
EDwsd242:68	S18:	 what we want to present is we want to present erm our best case and wanna er do ou- we want to give our recommendations o- on the best case and not 
EDwsd242:69	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:70	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:71	S8:	 def- th- that's a good one that's absolutely a good one i i was going to talk about that 
EDwsd242:72	S2:	 sounds logical 
EDwsd242:73	S8:	 er now actually cos er cos we have 
EDwsd242:74	SS:	 @@@@@@
EDwsd242:75	S8:	 identified two groups who are working on the best case scenario

EDwsd242:77	S8:	 to condense it's into a 
EDwsd242:78	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:79	S8:	 sor- short presentation and the worst case scenario but there's also a group er which we will call the presentation group which makes the recommendation and all the things about the form of er the presentation so the introduction er the order the arguments erm 
EDwsd242:80	S2:	 and the recommendations 
EDwsd242:81	S8:	 also i mean that quite literally the form like er play or powerpoint er we we actually we suggest you to use the 
EDwsd242:82	S2:	 powerpoint 
EDwsd242:83	S8:	 powerpoint presentation
EDwsd242:84	S2:	 because it's a big audience and a big hallway so if you don't have anything big to show visually i think you might lose the attention 
EDwsd242:85	S8:	 er i- it's not about winning we @@ yeah 
EDwsd242:86	S2:	 no but it's more to to add something 
EDwsd242:87	S8:	 we said that x concept 
EDwsd242:88	S18:	 losing the audience is already er er bad 
EDwsd242:89	S2:	 hm sorry 
EDwsd242:90	S18:	 if we lost our audience that would be really really bad

EDwsd242:92	S2:	 exactly 
EDwsd242:93	S8:	 yeah
EDwsd242:94	S2:	 so just to to stimulate the presentation 
EDwsd242:95	S8:	 will be strongly suggested
EDwsd242:96	S2:	 for example powerpoint would be nice and maybe in the scenarios you can do a short play or short like you did with the radio er stuff or with the you know but

EDwsd242:102	S8:	 er i hope it is er erm well er we have this so we have the three groups now the worst case scenario group the best case scenario group and the presentation group which works out the recommendations and the production

EDwsd242:281	SX-14:	 but what about the other groups then if if there's pretty much two groups working

EDwsd242:283	SX-14:	 they don't 
EDwsd242:284	S2:	 and they have to make a mini-presentation

EDwsd242:291	S2:	 so in that sense you can work together it's not like you cannot communicate with the other groups but it's like that's your task so you understand

EDwsd242:294	SX-f:	 no 
EDwsd242:295	SX-2:	 which
EDwsd242:296	S10:	 i also thinking that maybe somebody here would like to do the presentation tomorrow
EDwsd242:297	S2:	 yeah is there anybody 
EDwsd242:298	S7:	 is it just going to be one person or people from one someone from each 
EDwsd242:299	S2:	 no 
EDwsd242:300	S2:	 one person i suggest
EDwsd242:301	SX-8:	 well may 
EDwsd242:302	S8:	 ma- maybe th- this was just er er a suggestion for a procedure which we forgot so i- if if you have a better i a better idea w- we can of course discuss that 
EDwsd242:303	S7:	 can i was i i thought what would have been logical was 
EDwsd242:304	S8:	 so if you 
EDwsd242:305	S7:	 there's going to be each group working on one different part of the presentation so one person from each part we can all do the presentation together so that'd be 
EDwsd242:306	SX-2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:307	S7:	 six of us or something or is that not right 
EDwsd242:308	S2:	 but then the problem is that nobody is gonna write the report for example and that nobody will come up with some backup information
EDwsd242:309	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd242:310	SX-f:	 mhm
EDwsd242:311	S2:	 so then you would have to d- divide you want to divide yeah then you would have to divide within your subgroup somebody who's gonna work on the report i mean 
EDwsd242:312	S7:	 cos i don't i don't understand how if we split up into different groups like group o- group one where we presenting the worst case hh how can the person who we choose to do the whole presentation is gonna have the same knowledge that we've had working on the worst case to present it all 
EDwsd242:313	SX-f:	 yeah
EDwsd242:314	S2:	 no but that's why you do the part of the worst case these three minutes somebody of four or of the subgroup one 
EDwsd242:315	SX-f:	 ah 
EDwsd242:316	S2:	 will also do this part of the presentation the presentation group person only makes it one ball so he intro- he introduces it then you come for example 
EDwsd242:317	S7:	 ah okay
EDwsd242:318	S2:	 then the one of the best case comes for example and then the person of the presentation rounds it up with the common recommendations and the conclusion
EDwsd242:319	S7:	 ah okay i understand now 
EDwsd242:320	S2:	 so there can be three persons for example doing the whole presentation together of course you have to you know cooperate on that 
EDwsd242:321	S7:	 i was x clear 
EDwsd242:322	S2:	 that it's a logical sense yeah
EDwsd242:323	S7:	 right i thought it's just gonna be one person for everything 
EDwsd242:324	S2:	 no 
EDwsd242:325	S2:	 but i would suggest for every part to use one or two persons and not too many because i think the time is some short if you use too much persons too many persons it's gonna be too long and too fuzzy

EDwsd242:517	SX-14:	 yeah that was my question

EDwsd242:524	SX-f:	 but that's what you were going to say 
EDwsd242:525	S2:	 no because it's gonna be a slightly shorter version of what they did this morning and you know what the worst case and the best case is because we talked about it hh and so the only thing you have to do is make a short introduction like for example what is our theme what what is the theme of the forum you can say something short about that then the worst case the best case then you go over to the recommendations
EDwsd242:526	S10:	 mhm
EDwsd242:527	S2:	 and the conclusion
EDwsd242:528	S18:	 so what we basically do is if i understand this correctly now erm we provide a frame 
EDwsd242:529	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:530	S18:	 and this is going to be filled in by the others we basically know what is going to be said 
EDwsd242:531	S2:	 mhm 
EDwsd242:532	S18:	 because i mean we heard everything this morning erm so 
EDwsd242:533	S2:	 yeah you can still look at the scenarios
EDwsd242:534	S18:	 we 
EDwsd242:535	S18:	 yes so so we erm have the chance to er well to give a more or less creative introduction 
EDwsd242:536	S2:	 yeah 
EDwsd242:537	S18:	 and erm style of the whole thing 
EDwsd242:538	S2:	 exactly short introduction and here are the recommendations of course these are all the recommendations we have but try for example what you can try is state this as clear as possible for the audience you know maybe put them in a put them in a different order you know aim that this is the main aim for example in which order will you present it make it 
EDwsd242:539	S9:	 arrange them
