POwsd258:10	S1:	 yeah 
POwsd258:11	S2:	 erm in my personal opinion i think it was first if you look at all the panel i think we tried to put a variety of experiences a variety for places and erm people i think it's good we have different perspectives what is the euro- the european youth pact for different parts of the participants er i think it maybe sometimes it gets a little bit long 
POwsd258:12	S1:	 hm 
POwsd258:13	S2:	 maybe people should speak a little bit less and after we can put some questions it would be better but anyway i think it was quite er interesting a lot of information has passed by some of good practices and er good experiences had already passed by
POwsd258:14	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd258:15	S2:	 erm maybe i could say that er if you never heard about the youth pact it could be a little bit complicated to to understand it anyway since we have a documentation on all this er information about it i think it was er balanced in the way that we have different perspectives and at the same time erm some ideas about how to how to to solve it about the subject in yourself about the youth pact when you speak about that i don't know if we need to speak here or we speak that i- er later 
POwsd258:16	S1:	 erm what i really want to know what has been your opinion during persons about the plenary and then we are going to analyze it and xx 
POwsd258:17	S2:	 ah okay okay 
POwsd258:18	S1:	 erm in one side we will analyze how we can improve fascinational xxxx international xx organizations the knowledge between our people about the youth pact
POwsd258:19	S2:	 okay 
POwsd258:20	S1:	 both from the national to the local level and vice versa but now it's er the local they normally don't have the information so it has to go from the bottom hh down from up to the bottom and er we also we will reflect about what's the role as well of youth organizations really how we can move things not only information but how we can hh cooperate collaborate in the implementation and evaluation of the youth pact hh during this time and er these are my two main ideas if you have something more that it's you think is imporsible er it's important er er we to think about
POwsd258:21	S2:	 yeah just to finish so i like that part for for the the next discussion but i think it was important that the signators of the youth pact were here 
POwsd258:22	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd258:23	S2:	 so that's that's i think other interesting thing cos people actually have made these four countries at least represented it's important to have that

POwsd258:70	S7:	 hm 
POwsd258:71	S1:	 but if you put in a balance okay what should i do should i quit them now or should we listen to them and then let's try because the most important thing was the debate and my impression from the debate was that the people we did some questions but we should have done much more questions this these that has happened this morning here has not happened never ever 
POwsd258:72	S7:	 hm 
POwsd258:73	S1:	 and the european youth pact is one of the main tools that we have to implement our youth policy and we should be aware and both internationals and national youth councils we are the key factors

POwsd258:75	S1:	 we are key role players and we should take profit of all the spaces sure this can be done in a very different basis but i didn't say anybody please shut up both also because as for instance when you intervened

POwsd258:202	S11:	 from what i heard in the second part i think that er in general this exercise is is a good practice because er in a way it gives them as well a kind of responsibility to follow the issue or even if it was not done so much before then they have to prepare for it and they have to give evaluation of they work er on on the european youth pact in they country so these gives as well er er responsibility to them to to really see how how the issue is going on in they countries and i believe from participants they would like to see the representative from they government as well see and er

POwsd258:204	S11:	 in front of the table to see or sometimes to evaluate what they're saying i- and to compare what is happening in real i- in the countries but er so i see this er plenary as a good exercise to er to er to make them follow the issue and as well to include them in in the discussion on the european youth pact in the way that it's important not only to us we could have seminar just ourselves to discuss and to make er hh some ways out er after this er seminar but hh including them as well gives us er some er er i will say some er some ways to to go on er with the issue further

POwsd258:357	SX-f:	 no 
POwsd258:358	S2:	 i think that erm in general what's happening i i know a lot of organizations at national international level but we have at least four parameters that it's difficult to have in each organization first one is time cos it's voluntary work so much of us don't have enough time to work on the ideas to read the documentation to go to the internet and and look for it so er what usually it's better is that we receive directly the information without too many effort then hh could use that information directly on our organizations but sometimes we don't have the time to do it the other one is the information itself because sometimes the information co- comes on a policy paper a big one actually it's difficult to read even for people who actually is on the top of the organizations we could read it but our members definitely i speak for [place3] don't read it the third could say we could call it participation cos some of our organizations want to participate some others don't have a clue about how to participate and some others don't want at all to participate so when you have national organizations and you have also regional organizations er the things turn a little bit worse because hh if it's possible to do something at national level it's much more difficult to for instance talk about the the european youth pact to an organization a regional one with two hundred members who actually don't have a clue about what it is or er for what it er could be used for instance so we could talk about participation and interest on the on the documentation and the last one but i think it's still difficult is the communication between organizations because because what i feel at general level is that er you could have two hundred organizations on the same umbrella but it doesn't mean that this two hundred organizations are able to communicate between themselves so we could say okay you have a national youth forum you have a regional er organization who actually is an umbrella of several organizations but again it doesn't mean that between all these organizations it's possible to make a link because sometimes you are even competitor to each other so using all of these four ideas i could say that it's nice to have a an european youth pact it's nice to discuss this at the european level but to pass this from the european level to the national level it's not that easy because sometimes we don't have the same luck as some governments and some countries who actually have a government who actually want to speak with people and want to speak with young people and want to put young people in the center of the policies et cetera et cetera but we have a government who actually don't have a clue about what are the organizations don't care about the opini- the opinion of the organizations because they even could say okay we are we have been elected we have a program for youth who actually had been elected by the people sometimes we are even the majority on the parliament so everything you could say about the youth and youth policy and all the things could be something that we can take care about or we can care about it but it doesn't mean directly that we should work on it and work with you also so the representation of the organizations at national level could be very strong and i know some organizations in some country actually they are very strong on this contact with the government but could also be nothing cos if development want don't want to listen to us we don't have any at least i speak for [place3] we don't have we have a council the x council where we could speak about but we can speak it doesn't mean that they hear us 
POwsd258:359	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd258:360	S2:	 so at the end it's nice to have the information i think the youth forum is very important to have this but most of our members don't have even maybe sometimes i could say that maybe they don't know even the webmail or the website of the the youth forum or some other organization because the idea that we have from europe is that europe is nice something very very far away so what we are care is our own re- reality our own perspective and if you don't have this broader view it's quite difficult at this level with the organization

POwsd258:545	S2:	 me okay erm first about the european youth pact i think that global problems need a kind of global approach so it explains that er why everybody in europe is trying to speak about european youth pact because if you have a global approach on this everybody would benefit with it so i think this is clear for everybody and we don't have too many doubts but the question is that we are waiting like a kind of for a kind of a miracle first we know that the european youth pact won't solve all the problems we know that the european you- youth pact could be a very important tool in order to press the government and to to make pression at the national level at the regional level et cetera et cetera et cetera so it must be seen as a tool

POwsd258:547	S1:	 yeah
POwsd258:548	S2:	 but we cannot solve the problem of participation of young people of the organization we cannot solve with this the problem of erm inequality o- er equality on information we cannot solve the problem of er quality of information and information available for everybody but at least we can try to cut some some barriers and try to say okay we have this tool this tool as this different approaches and there is different er ways of work we have good practices from this government who actually has done this this and this we have good practice on some organizations so actually have achieve this this and this but all of this situations we can only get with first money and we are discussing how much governments are investing on youth we can solve with time for youth er representatives which they don't care for it now most bəbəbəs we are discussing of quality of the youth representatives because to to be a representative of youth i need to have time i need to have education i he need to participate on seminars like this to know better i need to know the people who actually is on the other parts of the country on the other parts of the of europe so all of these needs a kind of global approach and you- the youth pact is this is this nice tool that you can say okay let's try to make something to everybody in order that we are at least speaking the same language let's call it european language like we want to have a pact on from all the governments a national pact could be why not a regional pact could be why not 
POwsd258:549	S3:	 mhm 
POwsd258:550	S2:	 but the question is how can we help to solve the problem and not be only a part of the problem and this is quite a miracle if you achieve this i think that we have achieved like two hundred years of evolution but let's try to do it it's it's our work so we try to do the best as we can with the gaps that we have with the reality that we have including with the members that we have because sometimes it's they are they don't have a clue and they don't want to know what is this and what is the purpose of all of this because they don't realize that the global problems are have an impact on the difficult problem so we cannot save the world but we can save some

POwsd258:680	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwsd258:681	S1:	 er but in order this to happen it's member organizations and one asking this to happen i don't know if you're very much aware with the deadlines in order to create a work plan so in june there will be the first erm deadline for a

POwsd258:686	S7:	 mhm 
POwsd258:687	S1:	 revises ideas and do it again and we are sending ideas for several months
POwsd258:688	S7:	 mhm 
POwsd258:689	S1:	 and then in the g a in november the work plan 
POwsd258:690	S7:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd258:691	S1:	 we will xx okay my idea 
POwsd258:692	S6:	 [S1] 
POwsd258:693	S6:	 yo creo que es importante tam- tambien 
POwsd258:694	S1:	 habla mas alto 
POwsd258:695	S1:	 mhm so what [S6] is proposing is erm in activities with a related with employment education and so on in done in the national level trying to link this activities as well in some way to the youth pact in order to give visibilization of the youth pact and the the youth european policies and as well trying to do it the other way around so we are speaking about the european youth pact in the european level try to give examples to read examples of what has been done in the national level hh in order to make these things the the european with the local and so on 
POwsd258:696	S5:	 mhm 
POwsd258:697	S1:	 okay visibilization visibly 
POwsd258:698	S5:	 visibly 
POwsd258:699	S1:	 with t 
POwsd258:700	S2:	 may i make a stupid question
POwsd258:701	S1:	 yeah
POwsd258:702	S2:	 is there a translation to every country of the european youth pact
POwsd258:703	S1:	 erm normally if the european youth pact is only one sh- er sheet of paper
POwsd258:704	S5:	 european council 
POwsd258:705	S1:	 and it's a european council that er 
POwsd258:706	S5:	 xx translated this 
POwsd258:707	S1:	 it's er translated to all and which is in the european union the problem is that for instance er the documents that we er do in the in the european youth forum they're only produce it in french and in english because they are the two er languages of the platform and maybe one of the possibilities we should do in our platforms is try to translate these er documents to our language in order we can work better with our own member organizations 
POwsd258:708	S5:	 mhm 
POwsd258:709	S2:	 yeah but my question was er bec- because of this cos could be a prop- er proposal to to make is that all the organizations put on their website or on their information
POwsd258:710	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd258:711	S2:	 something about 
POwsd258:712	S5:	 the youth pact 
POwsd258:713	S2:	 the youth pact at national 
POwsd258:714	SX-4:	 mhm 
POwsd258:715	S5:	 mhm 
POwsd258:716	S2:	 national on the national language because 
POwsd258:717	S5:	 yeah 
POwsd258:718	S2:	 if i am from i don't know from portugal i don't know what is the youth pact 
POwsd258:719	SX-4:	 mhm 
POwsd258:720	S2:	 i cannot find it if it is in portuguese i don't know where to find it so if all the organizations have it it would be much easier to reach the regional level 
POwsd258:721	S4:	 but you need more a kind of a explanation to you can't just put 
POwsd258:722	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd258:723	S2:	 yeah you put you can put er some info- and that's what i meant 
POwsd258:724	S4:	 before you can put 
POwsd258:725	S4:	 you need in short kind of a explanation or what it is or what 
POwsd258:726	S2:	 some 
POwsd258:727	S2:	 information made by the national level could be translated by the erm could be made by the youth forum and then translated for each organization at national level and then put the youth pact on the language 
POwsd258:728	S3:	 i i've made a sort of a working document that er hh in dutch like er everything that has happened and then er the situation in the netherlands 
POwsd258:729	SX-f:	 yeah @
POwsd258:730	S3:	 so that erm when er someone wants information i can immediately er email with er to them 
POwsd258:731	SX-f:	 @@
POwsd258:732	S3:	 and then i just er you know i have to co- update it of course when new guidelines come out or something but er hh then you have immediately the information in dutch and they don't have to read the european youth forum or things so 
POwsd258:733	S5:	 yeah that's great 
POwsd258:734	S1:	 i xx have one idea i think it's very important er to work national youth councils with governments and also try to to work i mean in this kind of spaces for instance i will tell you something that we did two years ago in my region in [place1] er there the regional youth council meet within xxx which is as the youth ministry er we meet with all erm all the departments that were linked with the youth pact education er employment and so on and we also invited er the most important towns in the region sure the the regional youth council and the local youth councils and we were working during two days and a half together analyzing what has been done i mean in generally in 
POwsd258:735	S7:	 hm 
POwsd258:736	S1:	 education employment and so on how can we link this with the pact and with the pact and what can we do in the next er in the next years i think this kind of spaces of er working directly with er policy makers are very fruitful and are good for us our member organizations and for them hh as needing to to play with with somebody and they need to work with somebody 
POwsd258:737	SX-f:	 hm

POwsd258:750	S7:	 yeah it would also be good erm another added value of erm e u politics can always be er money provided by the e u yeah hh that's a good motivation for er on the local level to like implement projects if the 
POwsd258:751	S5:	 yeah 
POwsd258:752	S3:	 yeah 
POwsd258:753	S7:	 hh e u gives part of the money so hh it could be erm 
POwsd258:754	S3:	 yeah 
POwsd258:755	S7:	 a good way to like maybe put out er guidelines or erm yeah just pieces of advice hh erm where erm how to er apply for european funds i don't know i i personally i have no idea erm hh about er er the possibilities of using regional funds what she talked about this morning 
POwsd258:756	S3:	 mhm 
POwsd258:757	S7:	 yeah i don't know but hh erm it would be good to like give the links to also erm yeah the information pages okay er the you- youth program that's 
POwsd258:758	S3:	 yeah 
POwsd258:759	S7:	 done anyway but like hh erm 
POwsd258:760	S3:	 yeah xxx 
POwsd258:761	S7:	 those pieces of advice because that's good for people on the national and local level to know and use and then yeah they might do some more 
POwsd258:762	S3:	 yeah is cos it's always quite complicated so interpreting more 
POwsd258:763	S7:	 hm 
POwsd258:764	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd258:765	S1:	 what [first name4] said is that erm this time for lobbying in order to see where the money goes is finishing so if we really want for instance er if every member state having two persons of er the european social funding get or i don't know one person talked at dinner about it 
POwsd258:766	S7:	 mhm 
POwsd258:767	S1:	 of er the state we should start lobbying right now because if not this would be decided and once things are decided then it's 
POwsd258:768	S7:	 yeah yeah sure 
POwsd258:769	SX-5:	 but the question is 
POwsd258:770	S7:	 but i i don't erm i am not very good infor- very well informed about the the status of the erm 
POwsd258:771	SX-5:	 not too well 
POwsd258:772	S7:	 yeah what they 
POwsd258:773	SX-3:	 xxx 
POwsd258:774	S7:	 what they would decide erm if they decided now i don't know what they like erm 
POwsd258:775	S1:	 yeah 
POwsd258:776	S7:	 what they are 
POwsd258:777	S1:	 the time lining 
POwsd258:778	S7:	 no and what they are discussing about now so erm you always have to know like what erm is like the the the last 
POwsd258:779	S5:	 when to do things 
POwsd258:780	S7:	 yeah the thing they talk about 
POwsd258:781	S5:	 no the point is that on this particularly it's a bit complicated er forest because it's er mainly the national level you say it 
POwsd258:782	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd258:783	S5:	 so it's more you who can have er total access to the information than we can do
POwsd258:784	S7:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
POwsd258:785	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd258:786	S5:	 the point is that er at the european level there're some priorities which are decided upon as usual hh er like saying employment youth employment x employment this this this but it's very general and then each nation state is building their own strategy
POwsd258:787	S7:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd258:788	S7:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd258:789	S7:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd258:790	S5:	 er with you know like quantitative er use of money and er and er indications that they have to respect actually in the implementation of the use of the money and actually i think that we are exactly in the period today er in which the member states are developing that i admit that it's the best way of to say that the european youth pact should be one of the priorities and that money should be made up available through the european funds 
POwsd258:791	S7:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd258:792	S5:	 whether the eu- regional fund or the european social fund 
POwsd258:793	SX-3:	 mhm 
POwsd258:794	S5:	 but the difficulty is that i think that for this year it's a bit late because it's it's now 
POwsd258:795	S7:	 yeah yeah i- in germany we have the problem 
POwsd258:796	S5:	 so we had never spread the information 
POwsd258:797	S7:	 @
POwsd258:798	S7:	 erm in in germany it's not even the the the federal level that de- for example decides about the regional funds it's the yeah laender level 
POwsd258:799	S5:	 yeah it's it's the laenders 
POwsd258:800	S5:	 laender yeah yeah 
POwsd258:801	S7:	 so it's a mess @@@ @
POwsd258:802	S5:	 yeah exactly 
POwsd258:803	S5:	 but i 
POwsd258:804	S9:	 er i came up er come up with this idea yesterday some kind of conclusion deciding it whether you agree to it or not hh that is er to create some kind of volunteer working group that will have er educated i mean having university degree hh er working group er that will work with er people pupils let's then say er helping them doing their wor- homework hh er or whoever has erm er some difficulties to enter the university to hh help them to er create some possibilities erm to get into the univ- university help them er or- o- orient them or making them orientation which fill their good add and stuff like this a working group at every national maybe not a national youth council but at least a youth organization hm create a volunteer working group

POwsd258:806	SX-m:	 yesterday
POwsd258:807	S1:	 more or less xxxx volunteer to xx a relation and this is an idea that can be implemented er with working groups but it could be done in the local level and 
POwsd258:808	S9:	 mhm at least it will be the local level yes

POwsd258:859	S1:	 hm 
POwsd258:860	S9:	 it is very important that the hh youth n g os work in national regional and international level hh having young people to get to know relevant information hh to employment policies during our discussion we came up with the opinion that the main problem of youth hh unemployment it's first of all the lack of communication between ministries and hh youth n g os and the second is the lack of info- information be- betwe- between hh the x and member organizations
POwsd258:861	S2:	 can you add trade unions also
