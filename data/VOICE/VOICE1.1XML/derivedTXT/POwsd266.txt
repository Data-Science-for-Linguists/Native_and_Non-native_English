POwsd266:77	S1:	 before before we er er we go now er into the into the next points i just wanted to to come back a little bit to this seminar also because some of you arrived a little bit later and today and had missed the session yesterday where where some of the objectives and and the process to get here were were explained by [first name1] erm as you know european youth forum is this big platform of er of youth organizations comprising national youth councils on one side and international governmental youth organizations on the other side very diverse yeah er and there are many different interests that are are federated within the european youth forum erm and the topics on which the european youth forum works also vary a lot because of course they are the result of the interest that are put forward by the member organizations in order to be xx together er and the- therefore the member organizations of the european youth forum decided that social inclusion and employment and social affairs should be one of the main er working areas for the european youth forum and er that was very clearly reflected in the work plan of the european youth forum therefore we have proceeded to establishing a working group on social inclusion which drafted erm a first version of a policy paper on social inclusion which you i think have all received yeah erm there was also then an information and networking day with the member organizations where the different topics on social inclusion and employment were tackled erm this was also followed by a by a discussion among the member organizations as they are represented in the council of members this is the statutory body of the european youth forum they all discussed their policy paper and put forward some amendments modified it a little bit and adopted it as a policy paper which should be the policy framework in terms of social inclusion for the european youth forum and now that we have this policy framework so we know wha- what the member organizations er wanted from the european youth forum we can actually move on and therefore we have er organized this seminar which is about tackling er the problems of the precarious work conditions and the way to move forward from this in order to ensure better better jobs yeah so the as you as you've seen the the seminar is is made of of a er of of of a program which is splitted into two kinds of a of a sessions yeah there are the morning sessions where we when we receive guests and er they give some input f- from their perspective the yeah so er we have seen other n g os representatives hh er we have seen a commission representative we're going to have government representatives so this is already er an excellent space for you to challenge this guests yeah with with questions and to address your points of view your perspectives regarding the the topics they are they are addressing hh but then we also have the space in the afternoons when we can also actually go more in depth hh discuss what we really want so this is not when we position ourselves towards the other partners that we have yeah in er in er er in our work but this is to see what actually we want what we can do internally erm i say internally hh it means not only in the european youth forum but also things that you can bring back to your organizations things that you can can do more either in the national youth councils at the national level or either in the in the in your international organizations how you can federate cer- c- certain interests and address certain issues crosscutting europe erm but then also to see what kind of policy demands we have altogether what are so basically when we will discuss now more in depth how you feel about this about this topics yah what are the main problems in your countries or in x that your organizations which can be europeanwise yeah have identified we'll we'll try to see what we have all in common and based on that see what kind of policy recommendations we can er we can make erm at the end of this er working group we will go back in plenary so there will be a need for one person to actually report back to the plenary the the content of the discussions and that person won't be me because i'm just i'm i'm just trying to facilitate but you are the ones who are coming with the content yah so it should be one of you that that will speak on behalf of the group what is also important to know is that at the end of the seminar there will be a political declaration a declaration of the activity and er this declaration should complement let's say the the report there'll be a general report xx you know and will appear everything that has been done in the seminar but this political declaration will take the main points the main messages that that were thrown around the table yeah by by the different participants and in order to elaborate on this on this political declaration there will be a drafting committee working hard tomorrow night so the person who is going to be the rapporteur from this group should also go tomorrow night to this drafting committee and should try to bring in the in the final declaration the points that were discussed in this group so this is the this is the good part about being er being the rapporteur because you you get to speak in plenary and er 
POwsd266:78	SX:	 @
POwsd266:79	S1:	 and you also get to to bring the views which is quite challenging you know because it's not just a matter of bringing bringing one's er personal views yeah when when discussing the declaration but actually managing to to bring all the points from around the table but on the other side that means that that person should take also some notes

POwsd266:149	S1:	 so what i wanted to to propose you as a as some sort of structure for for the discussion but then of course i mean er let's look at this as a very flexible structure and we'll see according to your interests in discussing the different topics we can make it longer or shorter okay erm i was thinking that maybe it could be interesting to have a a very er short round of impressions from this morning maybe there are things that you would have liked to say this morning er but you didn't have the chance to or or maybe you thought it was too daring to say certain things er or you thought you would be too critical for example yeah so or to simply there are certain points that you found very useful and you would just like to go back to them er and just to remind you that we had er we had two sessions the first one was on er on the sources of discrimination and the second one was on er precarious work conditions 
POwsd266:150	S4:	 can i start
POwsd266:151	S1:	 yah 
POwsd266:152	S4:	 two two points about well this morning first of all and xx discrimination in malta right now we're we are passing through a big problem with with er illegal mig- irregular migration or basically you know how small malta is three hundred thousand people xx average about er i don't know seven thousand eight thousand there 
POwsd266:153	S9:	 yes 
POwsd266:154	S4:	 er come and go ve- by by by by sea if- er illegally hh and you can see it i mean in the past two years i mean our country has become much more discramatory towards these people than than than it was two years ago erm the problem is er er xxx when you speak to the people everyone tells you listen i'm xx xx go to our countries they're as well are you stealing our jobs or else if they're in closed centers and they're costing in the parliament er you don't xx is that that that problem i mean you can you can never obviously i mean 
POwsd266:155	S9:	 stealing our money taxes 
POwsd266:156	S4:	 i myself am never going to accept discrimination but but you understand you understand that point that's one of them towards discrimination the second one which is about precarious employment again a problem xxx in our country if you see our the th- th- the figures er with regards to education once again malta is at the very end xx education xxxx roads were lost and early school leavers were were fast xxxx again you know now we have i mean in malta universities are free we pay our students er money to actually go to university erm the culture is is very much er pro- pro-studying you know so we have the problem that i mean as such as as policy makers and government er we are doing our best to try and to try and er get these figures up but there again i mean we are lagging behind big time and and and the figures are are are bad and very bad and nearly fifty per cent of our people x of our pupils leave are are early school leavers so those are the two points that i'd like to have some some feedback on
POwsd266:157	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd266:158	S1:	 yeah
POwsd266:159	S12:	 well i mentioned something 
POwsd266:160	S1:	 okay
POwsd266:161	S12:	 oh so you wanna speak
POwsd266:162	S8:	 no 
POwsd266:163	S12:	 erm well since i'm i represent an international organization i do not specify in what country but more of a euro- pan-european perspective erm my organization has done research about social exclusion of l g b t youth erm we've done with seven hundred and fifty participants all over europe and we did it in collaboration with another larger l g b t organization called [org12] which is the [org12] hh and our the report that we er i- i'm actually looking at it now it's not finalized yet but we saw that there are very specific needs that l g b t youth experience in terms of social exclusion and employment and i- i- it on a wider scale they tend to experience discrimination in multiple aspects education and and then therefore employment it's like it's like i- everything is linked together and everything is linked as we were discussing this morning and erm when i was reading these policy papers and also listening to this morning and i've already discussed it with some people during lunch erm no- no one here sitting here my concern is that in terms of policy sometimes minority groups and we had two people from minor- minority groups they're not mentioned there is this yet youth issues we're discussing youth issues but there's also subdivisions multiple discriminations that occur which are very specific and what i would like to see [org11] would all like to see is that these specific erm these specific areas that need to be tackled need to be start to be mentioned and need to be brought forward to to key stakeholders so things can be start moving in terms of specific areas or specialization in terms of work that needs to be done specific services that need to be created erm it will be more of a inclusive approach i believe in terms of different minorities and especially the ones that i'm representing here so that was my feedback from the first session erm and yeah

POwsd266:174	S1:	 good 
POwsd266:175	S5:	 er some of the key points er that i noted er from today's sessions er is that er organizations or workplaces that er the workforce er for a company should er somehow er reflect er the society er er and i think that's quite important er and also something that was mentioned by several of the speakers that a large part of the solution to unemployment and precarious work er is found in the educational system er and also i noted that erm information given er by the government or by the state er as well as er laws and information about laws should make it erm easier er for workers to exercise their rights er if it should come to that because erm as the guy from the trade union said a lot of people are er afraid er and they know even if they know their rights they're afraid afraid to exercise them

POwsd266:184	S8:	 sorry so i've got something something something to to say hh er it's for me it's really important to er to lay great stress on the know your rights hh s- and it's it's a mission of the trade unions its but er it's i'm i wonder i'm wondering if the states erm the the states must also hh to give opportunities to workers to know your to know their rights hh er and by the way of educational system al- also i think i think its something im- 
POwsd266:185	S1:	 but i think since since the point came in in your in your reflections from this morning we can keep it as a separate point maybe that 
POwsd266:186	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd266:187	S1:	 we could then go more in depth into no into the question of being aware of what are the rights that one has when working 
POwsd266:188	S2:	 hm 
POwsd266:189	SX-m:	 yeah yeah 
POwsd266:190	S1:	 and then maybe we could try to look more in depth into what kind of roles we could play as youth organizations so that we achieve that and maybe look at other actors state and maybe trade unions as it was reflected this morning no hh okay erm i don't know how how useful this would be but i had prepared just a a few points from the policy paper on social inclusion erm just the main points just in case you you do not feel that you had enough time to to go through the policy paper just that that you all have a er er

POwsd266:197	S1:	 okay er the paper on on social inclusion basically the signals er or or tries to draw the attention on important on the on the situation of young people which has become alarming in the in the last years er and on the on the degradation of er of young people's lives and incapacity that society has in including individuals and specifically young people from that perspective er the paper sets demands on on on certain points quite high demands towards er towards policy makers in terms of er of er young people's social inclusion 
POwsd266:198	SX-12:	 mhm 
POwsd266:199	S1:	 on the other side it underlines the the the important role that youth participation can play er as an important element of of policy which aims at improving the the social situation of young people so erm so it's it's very much about social inclusion but with a very strong component which is youth participation to that effect er this this approach of the youth forum is part of a bigger reflection which is on how to make societies in general more inclusive but also how to develop youth organizations to become more inclusive er another point is that er er underlines that the youth forum believes that policies aiming to tackle youth disadvantage and to promote young people's social inclusion er can only be succ- successful if these points are tackled in partnership by youth organizations with with er with er xx authorities so basically a structured dialogue is absolutely essential in order to address the issues of young people and the policy paper actually explains that at the E U level er what are considered by the e u to be the social partners do not include the youth organizations they only include the the trade unions on one side and the employers on the other side but youth organizations are not represented as a as a social stake holder when actually youth organizations federate er the youth and represent their interests and some of their interests and apparently according to what we have seen in the european youth forum these interests are social interests in in a in a large majority and this interests are represented via youth organizations so the paper also tackles the question of of er the necessity of involving the representatives of youth organizations in the social dialogue erm and therefore the youth forum basically with this paper asks for the involvement of youth organization on on the current debate on how to reform the european social model hh and er and shows how youth organizations should be recognized first in order to be able to provide an input in the in the partnership so er such a partnership cannot be realized immediately if there is not recognition of the role that youth organization play in in in society er it also underlines the role of youth organization in the development of the lisbon national reform programs and in that perspective er as you know the the lisbon strategy is one of the the highest er er items on the political agenda of the european union and er er thankfully enough for us and you know we're we're quite lucky for that the europe- the the european youth pact has been included in the lisbon agenda which basically means that youth is a priority for the moment because it is specified and included in the lisbon agenda but but they're national reform programs and the implementation of the national reform programs for the moment has shown that basically at the level of the implementation there is
POwsd266:200	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd266:201	S1:	 a lot a lot a lot left to do so even though there was this erm this political support xx including youth in the agenda er of the lisbon strategy this has not been done yet at the level at the national level and it needs to be followed and basically the european youth forum constantly asks through this paper but also through other papers er in general the european union to push the states to implement it and then er the other member organization are also pushing the the the national governments to do more in order to achieve er to achieve these objectives erm then the paper talks about a certain degree of security when accessing the labor market and it makes references to the minimum er standards er as they are expressed in the xxxxxx and to the right to a decent work as it is mentioned by the by international labor organization so there're certain minimum criteria let's say that are are tackled in the policy paper but er er but they are not they are not developed much in the paper of course as you understand this paper is a paper of the european youth forum and it is a result of negotiation between organizations which have very different interest so of course the paper is a is a result of the negotiation no between the different organizations hh er so these words they're the common standard let's say for for the member organizations but then you yourself each of you can actually look into how you can go further or do less if you so wish in er in your organizations based on that er and then er and then the paper also er also tackles the question of social inclusion when distinguishing between young people as a group and other groups in society so on one side is age discrimination but then also looks within the youth group and tackles diffr- other types of discriminations and here we go to what you were saying [S12] earlier on the on the question of multiple discrimination
POwsd266:202	S12:	 mhm 
POwsd266:203	S1:	 there is another policy paper of the european youth forum which is equality and diversity and that 
POwsd266:204	S12:	 which is very good 
POwsd266:205	S1:	 which is very good as well yeah and er and which tackles the same question yeah the question of diversity er because in the [org1] we prefer to look at this or we all of us huh prefer to look at this from the point of view diversity and not discrimination diversity means accepting the differences being aware of the differences but also being aware of the equality between all these differences and equality in terms of rights and er and equality in the sense that er i think one of the speakers was addressing xx earlier in the morning er equality in terms of access equ- equality in terms of opportunities and equality in terms of conditions so er er our our policy paper goes into into the same depth more or less the same direction so these are just just some points yeah for for reflection from from the policy paper but we can we can now go back to the to the two themes or to the question of discriminations on one side and the the question of precarious work on the other side hh and we could maybe start with i don't know the first one just to follow chronologically the the morning and erm i was thinking that it could be interesting to see what are the the situations that you have experienced at the a- in the different countries 
POwsd266:206	SX-m:	 @
POwsd266:207	S1:	 and what have been your organizations doing in order to tackle this type of er of situations and i think those who are coming from international organizations can maybe mention er er er several examples and how they were tackled in the the question er let's say more europe-wide whereas the ones coming from national youth council can can focus a little bit more on the situation at the national level erm and see what what the youth organizat- what your organizations have been doing if there are any any positions if there are any specific policy demands if there are any any specific opinions that you have and also if there are any other best practices in terms of projects campaigns er things that would be useful to share with the others so that er so that when we go back we we go a bit more enriched in in terms of of ideas so either we we go on with the with the discussion around this table in this group or if you prefer can also split into two smaller groups if you think that would facilitate the discussion 
POwsd266:208	S4:	 i suppose we're small enough huh
POwsd266:209	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd266:210	S1:	 haeh
POwsd266:211	S4:	 we're small enough huh

POwsd266:221	S1:	 okay 
POwsd266:222	SX-4:	 mhm 
POwsd266:223	S1:	 we have quite a lot of countries around the table so 
POwsd266:224	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd266:225	S1:	 so we can maybe look into for example which kinds of discriminations are are are the ones that er you feel are not necessarily enough tackled at the national level the ones that are being the most ignored or which are the the the different type of discrimination that you experience at the national level and maybe none of them is tackled properly yeah 
POwsd266:226	S5:	 okay i can just say er one thing about er discrimination er because erm in the political work er in norway er all the different parties have different strategies on how to er include minorities and help them go to work et cetera er but what er my youth organization er is er troubled with is that er all the politicians are trying to develop policies to help minorities and they are not a part of the minorities themselves and we looked at our own organization and we just did a study er which er i was responsible for and 
POwsd266:227	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd266:228	S5:	 we collected data of all the members we had er how many had a er background that was non-western er and er participated in our organization and we found out that er of all members it was actually really high ten per cent er but out of employees thirty employees zero er with a non- -western background er and the same with er high positions er er all of the people are running the organization er were not er a part of any minority themselves er and that's a problem er which we considered because we are supposed to make policies er to er help minorities er get work and you know be included and they are not being included in our own organization so it's kind of difficult and er i think that's something er a lot of er youth organizations and political parties er should take into consideration and we have we are trying to make er some sort of paper on how we can if if we demand that all the companies reflect the society then we at least should do so ourselves and we do not and we found that actually the the group most interested in er working with these questions are our girls from pakistan actually they the mos- when you ask them they are of all the people in norway they are the ones most interested in working with these questions but none of them do
POwsd266:229	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd266:230	S5:	 er and we find that it's because er when we arrange meetings and you know conferences like this er the fact that you have to stay overnight er is often er something that minorities er you know they they drop off because of that and because we don't do not write in our invitation that we can prepare this and this type of food er they drop off we have like a long list of things that we have to improve er in order to be more inclusive and i think that's important for er all the member organizations of the european youth forum to if the goal is to er represent the society in the companies and in the er workforce then the organizations have to do xxxx as well so that's really not a solution it's just one more problem 
POwsd266:231	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd266:232	S12:	 it is the lack of dialogue and the lack of knowledge 
POwsd266:233	S5:	 hm

POwsd266:235	S2:	 hm 
POwsd266:236	S5:	 yeah 
POwsd266:237	S12:	 and there's and sometimes there's this fear of this of this exchange happening and this is wha- wh- in the in the research we did this is one of the main one of the major problems that the l g b t people face in europe for example especially like 
POwsd266:238	S5:	 hm 
POwsd266:239	S12:	 in eastern europe there's such fear in the in visibility of actually coming out 
POwsd266:240	S5:	 hm 
POwsd266:241	S12:	 that if they do you know i can just say in eastern europe a lot of things have happening recently it's all very well been very much documented in poland and russia et cetera 
POwsd266:242	SX-f:	 xxxx mhm 
POwsd266:243	S12:	 so er you know if if there's this fear as well because sometimes a genuine fear of some minority groups especially invisible ones if they put themselves in the forefront that they will suffer cos of it and it's usually and it comes and usually manifests itself in such lack of self-esteem and ma- h- it has like these secondary effects on on on youth especially when you look in the mental health problems of young l g b t people face and suicide rates among l g b t people within you know which are a minority erm which is a discri- you know which is what they experience 
POwsd266:244	S3:	 mhm 
POwsd266:245	S3:	 yeah i also think erm the the reason why er there yeah be- in in er belgium there is a a yeah much of er youth unemployment is because of er the age because er the youngers are yeah too young they have no experience and the fact that they have no experience so an an employ- er employer yeah the erm yeah when he has a lot of candidates for a job he said okay er those with the most experience 
POwsd266:246	S4:	 xxx 
POwsd266:247	S3:	 i take that one because he has the experience but the youngers get yeah they get no chance because they have no- not the experience and a- where do they really find found found the experience when they

POwsd266:376	S12:	 very briefly and even multiple discrimination it just mentions that in one in one sentence and that's it it's quite discriminatory the road map i was quite disappointed when i read it but it was it was some- it was something they wrote to shut people up i thought but 
POwsd266:377	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd266:378	S1:	 but now i wanted to go back to something that you were you were saying earlier yah that certain groups certain minorities are not being represented at the policy making level yah and that therefore certain policy makers have not experienced certain forms of discrimination so that they are able to actually talk about it in an informed way yah and we kept xx on on talking about minority groups and then we come to the question of gender and can you consider gend- you know the er

POwsd266:386	S1:	 first 
POwsd266:387	S12:	 i think 
POwsd266:388	S1:	 and second of all with all these questions of different kinds of discriminations yah we can actually consider that there is a big majority that is not concerned that is not discriminated for anything at some point hh 
POwsd266:389	S2:	 actually erm i think that's a in one sense you can take women as a minority and that's in the sense of what space we have in society 
POwsd266:390	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd266:391	S2:	 so er people are usually usually worried about so that er okay we have a we we can implement the rights of women but we don't have to like suppress the rights of men but actually we do have to because the space in the society is the space in society and if women are s- using just a small part of the space we have to to to in- to get to the halfway we have to like
