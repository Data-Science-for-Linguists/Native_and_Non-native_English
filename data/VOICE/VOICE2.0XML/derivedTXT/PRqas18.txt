PRqas18:5	S1:	 er we have the disadvantage of having nationalities on our er er names but er it's not always hard for us because you very often need two countries you know country of background and the country where you are working or maybe a third one but er i know towns and [place1] college is not a very famous because it's in a very small city if you understand it it's er on the west coast of norway may i in- invite you to come and we'll have slides which makes it easier for us to discuss as well on this feeling thank you very much
PRqas18:6	S2:	 but if you want we could up there
PRqas18:7	S1:	 that's the easiest thing i think did you xxx for your slides then
PRqas18:8	S2:	 erm i have no slides because they're on one 
PRqas18:9	S1:	 uhu 
PRqas18:10	S2:	 good morning i come from norway er and my name is [S2] [S2/last] and i teach foreign students they stay in norway for up to six years but the first year they stay with us and learn norwegian and culture and if they succeed their exams they study they study further in norwegian they take their degrees in norwegian the language erm so far seventy-six er different cultures or or countries has been represented in my college over these fifteen years erm in order to study well i think a student need to feel comfortable and to feel comfortable if a foreign student need to know something about excuse me the the culture the codes er the signals they see around them therefore the first week when they come to us direct from the x we give them a a a course of eight hours in erm er cultural codes patterns er traditions that we think they adjust much more erm much better and much faster when we give them this er er outlines of the of the society erm foreign students are very polite and they want of course to be polite in a new country politeness is not a matter that of wrong and right but of expectations and when we come to another culture we look for the same codes of politeness as we have known in our own culture and when we do not see the same signals of politeness as at home in our own culture we tend to think this society is not polite not friendly
PRqas18:11	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:12	S2:	 and there is very often signs of frustration among the students they do not f- they don't do not feel at home they they feel strangers because they don't really see er they don't really er understand what they see around you or around them so for example when they go to a discotheque i- in in [place1] together with er norwegian students they have a nice evening together and then the next day they meet each other at the university and the foreigners they prepare to stop to have a little chat but the norwegian er students they just say hi and pass
PRqas18:13	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:14	S2:	 and the foreign students feel so bad oh it's because i'm a foreigner they don't like me and this is a cold indifferent society they conclude very fast with that
PRqas18:15	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:16	S2:	 erm an example would be an student from a country far away he wanted to be rude and impolite because he was so angry he was about to take his driving licence and then he didn't succeed and erm the norwegian officer that had decided so came and come up to him and said you didn't succeed and this foreign student was so angry and he said what he would have said to a man in his own culture the most bad thing he could think of i have had sex with your sister

PRqas18:44	S2:	 to erm what we do we have a grill party the first week we go for a bus ride together and have a lunch and then i have an obligatory conversation in the office for fifteen minutes where i do not ask what you expect from me as a teacher because i do not get answer they they are not quite prepared for that but i ask about how how was the methods when you learnt another language your second language er how was the teacher and then i get a picture of what they expect from a good teacher to erm er to be a student in norway is to evaluate you have to evaluate all the time the teacher the way of communication the books erm the exams anything you have to evaluate and some of the students are so polite they hesitate very much to erm 
PRqas18:45	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:46	S2:	 to tell their opinions and again in november the frustration is on top i notice that every year frustration is on top after three months then we have another obligatory erm conversation er in the office and i have a list of questions there that we don't have time to use but but erm one moment there is erm is obligatory what would you like to change everybody has at least one point one thing they would like to change i i have to get especial asian students used to this evaluation form because erm to be a a a student in norway you have to and also to be a student means to have the opinions of your own to disagree and to make students confident that this means for the exams also you get a better mark if you can have an argumentation against the books that is different from the teachers' er opinions 
PRqas18:47	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:48	S2:	 it's brilliant it's so good you will have a good mark it takes time for the foreign students to be confident on that they work it takes a year to be confident on that except for one thing i do not hide away in my feminist use when i teach
PRqas18:49	SX-f:	 mhm

PRqas18:93	S1:	 er in in in in such a context or 
PRqas18:94	SX-f:	 yeah 
PRqas18:95	S1:	 er can you just give us one indication on the number of hours you are teaching the language and the er percentage of the cultural things in it just to to to to have the framework of where you work in with your students

PRqas18:103	SX-f:	 mhm
PRqas18:104	S2:	 erm just briefly to give there are some major examples of erm what they believe they resume because they have this 
PRqas18:105	S1:	 mhm 
PRqas18:106	S1:	 how many weeks do you teach er how many weeks is the course
PRqas18:107	S2:	 the course is er ten months 
PRqas18:108	S1:	 okay and the intercultural thing is especially in the first week and 
PRqas18:109	S2:	 no no of course they they learn about norwegian society and the laws the history but in norwegian then
PRqas18:110	S1:	 hm so it is a year course more or less 
PRqas18:111	S2:	 yeah but 
PRqas18:112	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:113	S2:	 the point is to learn norwegian well enough to study further in norwegia- in norway in norwegian language of er they use the norwegian language if they study medicine or if they stu- study pe- petrochemistry anything 
PRqas18:114	SX:	 no 
PRqas18:115	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:116	S2:	 they use the norwegian language so it's a very hard study this first year
PRqas18:117	SX-f:	 hm 
PRqas18:118	S2:	 if not they have to go home if they do not succeed
PRqas18:119	SX-f:	 mhm yeah 
PRqas18:120	S2:	 they have to go home
PRqas18:121	S1:	 okay xxx er base to the floor for one or two questions 
PRqas18:122	S4:	 i'd like to ask about the beginning level of those student for instance who come to your course er have they got any er previous knowledge of the norwegian language or do you start from the scratch 
PRqas18:123	S2:	 we prefer to start from scratch
PRqas18:124	SX-f:	 oh @
PRqas18:125	S2:	 because er if they have stayed in norway for some while and nobody has you know s- s- er gi- er s- er 
PRqas18:126	SX-f:	 xx 
PRqas18:127	S2:	 advised them i think it's better to start from zero
PRqas18:128	SX-f:	 yeah 
PRqas18:129	S2:	 and most of them do they we have erm we have erm contracts with the universities around in the world and we have exchanges but that this is not erasmus and those 
PRqas18:130	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:131	S2:	 sort of thing they stay for up to six years in norway
PRqas18:132	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:133	S2:	 to study
PRqas18:134	SX-f:	 hm 
PRqas18:135	S1:	 okay one more question
PRqas18:136	S5:	 erm one of the first steps in acculturing students to your own culture is not to call them foreign students now the americans started this business of calling anyone who is coming in learning english just like in norway to be able to er pursue studies of the university level you know in medicine engineering whatever
PRqas18:137	SX-f:	 yeah 
PRqas18:138	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:139	S5:	 they are calling them international students
PRqas18:140	SX-2:	 mhm 
PRqas18:141	S5:	 which is a euphemism because ob- obviously everyone has a past everyone has an ethnic national identity but somehow somehow it sounds better because the word foreign has its own negative connotation built in i am norwegian you are a foreigner so i wonder if in europe for example there are language centers such as yours which actually use the same terminology as in the united states
PRqas18:142	SX-f:	 yeah 
PRqas18:143	S5:	 or else you still call all these students foreigner
PRqas18:144	SX-f:	 yeah
PRqas18:145	S2:	 well it's a matter of erm tradition i think in our country it especially for the students who are not immigrants 
PRqas18:146	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:147	S2:	 and we have it in our name we also call it international groups er but that is something else we reserve that word for those e- erasmus students er the exchange students
PRqas18:148	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:149	S2:	 and they this is a habit of long tradition and i appreciate your advice @ but but erm er in in our context it it's not negative to say foreigner
PRqas18:150	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas18:151	S5:	 yeah right 
PRqas18:152	S2:	 because i mean stranger 
PRqas18:153	SX-f:	 mhm
PRqas18:154	S1:	 now thank you for your remark the problem is that i know 
PRqas18:155	S5:	 but 
PRqas18:156	S5:	 it's 
PRqas18:157	S5:	 it should to respond the perspective of the student i'm talking ma'am not from your own perspective
PRqas18:158	S2:	 i see 
PRqas18:159	S2:	 i see your point
PRqas18:160	SX-m:	 mhm

PRqas18:174	S2:	 okay but the first week they are foreigners
