POmtg404:5	S1:	 join us er eventually but er it's a pleasure to to welcome you here for this er this meeting er it's a i think an- anyhow a good idea to to meet and er share points er on our various missions and er processes and the specifically in er in these er [name1] er [name2] process times it's a evidently a major reason for for for this meeting being called now is that ministers in [name1] er in the communiqu√© asked [org1] to set up this process of identif- -fying er standards of the for the quality of higher education and er peer-review agencies and er taking in their process er due account of the expertise of other quality assurance networks and organizations so that's what we are going to do from the [org1] perspective er during this meeting er get get your feedback in terms of the position or the place we have arrived at at in the in the [org1] process and er as we conclude our meetings and get to item five on er future contact and cooperation between the organization we can discuss how to proceed further in in that direction so er we we have an agenda which is er partly the fir- the second item where we er present aims and means of of the networks by by way of a general introduction and then what's probably going to be the sort of focal point er the various positions towards the [name1] mandate of on quality assurance leading to to to a general discussion er amongst us so erm i'm sure we'll have a a fruitful day er in terms of practical er comments for one i introduced to you in my mail last week er er [S2] from from austria who is doing this interesting project

POmtg404:45	S1:	 yes that's an impressive get-together as we can all hear and er we only miss er [first name1] [last name1] from er from the commission er but evidently a lot of experience in er european higher education and the quality of same er is er gathered around this table which is only good so er let's proceed to to the second item er general presentations of er the aims and er and means of er of the networks and er i would like to ha- to start off with er with [org1] it's er for [org1] er the last the last year has be- been er sort of a very intensive one in in in terms of er of the the process and er actually the workload er involved i mean several of you are of course familiar with the with the with what we're doing in er in the [org1] context but the put it in this way it's two processes that more or less have have merged er during the the the proceeding ones and and and one process has been a sort of [ORG1] internal or whatever you would call the process where [org1] has er taken up the challenge to reform itself into a another kind of organization more fit to er fulfil the need for [org1] to take up the political mandate which er ministers and others er threw upon us actually already in er the ministerial meeting in er in [place9] in er in two thousand and one which we had to adapt to for the very simple reason that we were basically a network set up to share best practices amongst agencies and organize seminars and workshops and er issue interesting publications and methodologies so so this this other task of actually being a political organization we were not born into it and and er by manner of the way in which we had er organized ourselves we weren't completely fit fit either just to mention one thing i mean 
POmtg404:46	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg404:47	S1:	 we have a steering group which is eminent to the extent that m- most of the people sitting in it at the same time have very responsible jobs as head of er large organizations example [S5] [S5/last] and myself and then we have one staff member situated in i- in helsinki which er is not the helsinki that's the problem it's the one staff member that's the problem
POmtg404:48	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg404:49	S1:	 considering the the magnitude of some of our tasks so which must been very obvious that we had to move into this reform process which we will present to the general assembly where some of you will er in stockholm next we- week where some of you'll also be present and where where we aim to er present a a move from being a network into a more formalized er registered er association er we have an agreement with european commission that we'll have funding which will er make it possible to expand the staff at least to three er full time er staff members and we are strengthening the the the the board as well er we'll have the direct election of a president er and er we have decided to propose to the general assembly that the present membership composition which strangely enough is part the agencies and part the government members

POmtg404:64	S11:	 yes yes 
POmtg404:65	S1:	 where we are going to get i mean who will argue against increased funding and @ but er i'm sure there may be arguments in terms of the of the membership criteria
POmtg404:66	S11:	 yah 
POmtg404:67	S1:	 but that's part of the credibility issue in terms of the quality assurance agencies that we must in that sense our own integrity as as organizations must be above any criticisms from those with whom we evaluate so that's again in a brief format [S11] did i leave out anything important 
POmtg404:68	S11:	 hh er not really just perhaps one item that the er the the basic reason that we are making the membership criteria more detailed was the fact that over this last er four years it has been rather difficult for the steering group to er be able to determine exactly the real status and credibility of 
POmtg404:69	S1:	 hm 
POmtg404:70	S11:	 our applicant members so this is why er i mean the steering group functions as a membership review board as well

POmtg404:118	S1:	 than we've been before and that's er i- it's good you took up the point because that's obviously in the future a major challenge that there'll be great differences between those who've been in operation for ten years or more and tho- -se who are very very new at the in in the field

POmtg404:136	S1:	
POmtg404:137	S7:	 hm 
POmtg404:138	S1:	 that's that's a good point because i think that will obviously be the implication that we we need to be

POmtg404:140	S9:	 hm 
POmtg404:141	S1:	 sort of proactive towards some of these countries and i mean we we never in [org1] did as i recall it we never did any kind of sort of consultative services towards newcomers telling them what they should do in order to become er relevant for for for membership i think this we may have to consider

POmtg404:408	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:409	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:410	S7:	 that's what we 
POmtg404:411	S7:	 we are going to advise our ministry to adopt a treaty with the countries that we are saying tha- that we could easily get to mutual recognition of these er degrees and these procedures or standards but of course that's er er it must be the basis will xx be a legal treaty yes so that's er what we erm discussed with the ministry the ministry gave us explicitly this role this legitimate role to find out about investigate about hh what the others are doing and if we feel that it's er it's up to our standards or we are up to the standards of the others then advise our governments to have a treaty and to accept each others procedures or roles
POmtg404:412	S1:	 [S10] 
POmtg404:413	S10:	 yes thank you i would like to to er go back to the moment when the [name4] convention was adopted well it's i- it is about recognition of individual qualifications and i think the core bologna process is about a possibility for each individual to be recognized in in any of the bologna countries in an ideal case so at that time of course we knew that it would be nice to base er the recognition on quality assurance but there were very few countries that had any quality assurance system hh system at least er er countrywide there was some in the universities but you cannot accept it so we had to er yes it is based on the er on the mutual trust between the systems but how do you build that mutual trust and the only instrument er for that moment was er that er the qualification in question must be er officially belonging to a er educational system which in practice means that if you call the ministry or the [org5] [org4] center in that country the answer is yes we know that is a normal quality but we don't know why why they say so we just trust them hh so er such check of each others' quality procedures now seven years later that is a major step forward so i i i think that is where we should go in the sake of the individuals moving from one country of it to another er one more point in the recommendation to the [name4] conventions and re- recommendation and criteria and procedures adopted in two thousand one we talk about substantial differences bet- be- because any non-recognition is based upon substantial differences well in content in learning outcomes but also in quality but up to now 
POmtg404:414	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg404:415	S10:	 we can only say we base it upon quality and the quality measurement is just asking a colleague in that country what do you think about that program
POmtg404:416	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg404:417	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg404:418	S10:	 so if we have an agreed 
POmtg404:419	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:420	S10:	 understanding of quality between different countries it will move forward the whole thing very much so i i would welcome any kind of of that act- er er of such activities because of xx 
POmtg404:421	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:422	S1:	 but i mean what this is int- an very interesting discussion because actually there are two ways of appro- approaching a shared need to be able to understand the quality of the processes in individual countries one is to accept the fact that we are i guess hh at least in the foreseeable future going to be quite different in our 
POmtg404:423	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:424	S1:	 basic approaches and say well but 
POmtg404:425	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg404:426	S7:	 absolutely 
POmtg404:427	S1:	 then we make a system where at least we have some membership criteria with european organization and if they fulfil them it is s- some kind of stamp of credibility operations or we have the [org3] model which is a 
POmtg404:428	S3:	 mhm 
POmtg404:429	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:430	S1:	 sort of bottom-up process where we say and it's interesting because er i- i- i was struck too when you set out last year by the sort of closed shop approach because you might have invited the hungarians they were after all the the oldest accreditation but you didn't 
POmtg404:431	S10:	 yah 
POmtg404:432	S7:	 yah yah of course yah 
POmtg404:433	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:434	S1:	 and as i saw now wi- i i saw the the parallels of what happened in the early nineties when the dutch and the danes and the british and the french got together and actually set up the pilot project 
POmtg404:435	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:436	S1:	 we were four of us so we were able in a sort of very constructive operational manner to do something fast 
POmtg404:437	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:438	S1:	 so in that sense as we are probably doing the right thing by a small well-organized group 
POmtg404:439	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg404:440	S1:	 but as i say this is the bottom-up 
POmtg404:441	SX-6:	 yah 
POmtg404:442	S1:	 whereas [org1] in sen- -se represents the top-down a- a- approach

POmtg404:445	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:446	S1:	 er both can probably work er well together but we do i mean i have an an anecdote i've told you the number of times which is illustrative in the early nineties the american department of health wrote to a number of eu- western european countries and asked them to provide documentation that their medical studies were accredited because if they were not pos- students could not be accepted for postgraduate students er studies in the states and so i was asked by the danish government to reply to this strange letter and i described our pro- procedures and in a couple of months there was an american reaction which was this is not accreditation

POmtg404:449	S7:	 hm 
POmtg404:450	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:451	S1:	 so i went down to my desk and wrote another letter where i translated the danish process into accreditation's terms which is in a sense not an a difficult thing and it was accepted my colleague [first name5] [last name5] in his

POmtg404:547	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:548	S6:	 er probably er m- main features of er higher education systems in eastern europe are connected with th- er the special role of accreditation and er in all these countries we have a type of accreditation agencies so usually there was a trial to see accreditation as some type of er more or less er state regulation which is too er a type of too centralized systems too managed but in fact er er in many of our countries it's not er in all but er in many especially central european hungary czech republic slovakia we have erm in fact academic freedom and higher education institutions are autonomous erm it is in czech republic it is since nineteen nin- ninety eight er and er we have bent a new law on higher education was passed and er with the new autonomy er came the necessity to evaluate all institutions and study programs
POmtg404:549	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:550	S6:	 and er in er our case or hungary and and erm probably it's a majoritany approach we have accreditation of study programs and evaluation of institutions and hh and accreditation of study program is based on evaluation of study program so in fact er the accreditation commissions usually evaluates study programs and institutions and provide advice to ministries of education which issue accreditation decisions er this certificate so er in fact accreditation commission hh doesn't issue any accreditation certificate to institutions x 
POmtg404:551	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:552	S6:	 for study programs and er er er it's er very different for example in austria er institutions are accredited and [org13] accredits on its own right as it as you know is a member of [org3] as well so there are m- m- many er types of systems at the moment and in fact erm the initiative was somehow to let's say transmit er kn- knowledge and approaches connected with [org1] 
POmtg404:553	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg404:554	S6:	 to central europe and somehow to disseminate good practice er knowing that we are somehow different due to historical xx due to er lack of finance certainly because er erm a- erm on all of eastern and central european higher education systems are underfinance so certainly even our network has some difficulties so our er aims are not very ambitious we usually have assembly every or we should have assembly every two years hh steering committee which is comprised for from five member agencies er once a year and usually we have er once a year a workshop on some special interesting aspects of evaluation and accreditation procedures and we plan or er er prepare some er other common activities er this is er a trials er to make a comprehensive survey of of all evaluation agencies in certain eastern europe w- we publish er we published once i- er two years ago and now there is new edition prepared

POmtg404:559	S7:	 mhm mhm

POmtg404:658	S7:	 why are you doing mutual recognition because 
POmtg404:659	S6:	 mhm 
POmtg404:660	S7:	 enhancing mobility of students
POmtg404:661	S6:	 yes 
POmtg404:662	S6:	 exactly i'm not only xx as well do requirements of quality er of qualification er acceptance always er very important somehow even er even if we take in account two countries which er were one until nineteen ninety-three slovak and the czech republic 
POmtg404:663	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:664	S6:	 er xx education systems erm moved apart and are already differentiated and it is er very important to agree on some transparent practices some transparent approaches in evaluation because otherwise we have some difficulties because languages are very similar 
POmtg404:665	S1:	 hm 
POmtg404:666	S6:	 according to some er legal er possibilities it is possible to er habilitate in slovakia for er czech academics or to

POmtg404:672	S6:	 result transparency 
POmtg404:673	S1:	 yah 
POmtg404:674	S6:	 we then may have some er let's say let's accept xx professors which are however are are are accepted in the czech republic i think because if somebody cannot habilitate if you do if you do problems er i- in his research activities publications et cetera 
POmtg404:675	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:676	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:677	S6:	 in the czech republic erm it happens so frequently he tries to go to some slovak er university not not exactly to [name7] in bratislava but to some 
POmtg404:678	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:679	S6:	 er some regional university and habilitates and then he becomes associate professor and comes back so it's one problem then certainly mobility of students because otherwise how to accept credits only on the basis that er study programs 
POmtg404:680	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:681	S6:	 were evaluated and accredited 
POmtg404:682	S3:	 hh 
POmtg404:683	S6:	 were somehow certified 
POmtg404:684	S1:	 [S5] 
POmtg404:685	S5:	 that raises an interesting question which erm is slightly tangential to the conversation but it's about erm recognition of credits and how far the ought i mean it seems to me there were two ways of dealing with this q- this this recognition question 
POmtg404:686	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:687	S5:	 one is the accreditation where somebody goes and makes a decision 
POmtg404:688	S6:	 mhm 
POmtg404:689	S5:	 and then others accept that decision a- and the other is er verified information er which is actually not making a decision 
POmtg404:690	S7:	 no 
POmtg404:691	S3:	 but saying this is what goes on in this university or in this country 
POmtg404:692	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:693	S5:	 and if that's what you want and you can accept for your purposes then the information is okay 
POmtg404:694	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:695	S5:	 the other one is say we will make a decision on your behalf 
POmtg404:696	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:697	S5:	 and in the case of the er the erm er mobility question erm i- it interests me the notions of mobility accreditation and mutual rec- not so much credit mutual recognition for mobility er is very interesting erm er er especially in the light of what seem to me to be fairly pessimistic views of estimates of how much mobility there ever actually is going to be 
POmtg404:698	S7:	 hm 
POmtg404:699	S5:	 erm major mobility flows and er an- an- and er who th- who are going to be the mobile students
POmtg404:700	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:701	S5:	 because i think the best estimates at the moment were about ten per cent aren't they o- of european students are likely to actually be mobile 
POmtg404:702	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:703	S6:	 mhm 
POmtg404:704	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:705	S5:	 so we're going to a er wh- what we're doing is we're setting up systems of ma- mutual recognition for that ten per cent essentially and er but the important thing about that ten per cent is they're likely to be very influential 
POmtg404:706	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:707	S5:	 the ten per cent because the people who aren't mobile can't be the ones who are going to be getting around 
POmtg404:708	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:709	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:710	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:711	S5:	 the movers and shakers 
POmtg404:712	S7:	 yah 
POmtg404:713	S5:	 so it- it's quite interesting to track the erm the er implemen- not the implementation but the fo- or development processes which lead to o- one or other or different solutions for mutual recognition question and mobility question but you are going for the mutual recognition approach through accreditation rather than through er informed inf- through verified information 
POmtg404:714	SX-3:	 no 
POmtg404:715	S5:	 on that problem 
POmtg404:716	S6:	 no i would say that er it should be mostly by evaluation process 
POmtg404:717	S5:	 yes 
POmtg404:718	S6:	 er er er this is a problem of er accept decisions of other agencies or on the 
POmtg404:719	S5:	 yes 
POmtg404:720	S6:	 basis of transparency or procedures er a- and practices 
POmtg404:721	S5:	 yes but th- the the difficulty there is is as well the difficulties of erm er recog- recognition as opposed to acceptance that is the same we can have general recognition

POmtg404:723	S5:	 and degree from from a a degree for one country er has the following characteristics or satisfactory it the want of mo- be mobile and transfer into a into a second country the question really is does that mean then that a that a the university has to accept them and automatically and if it doesn't then what do they have to do in ad- in addition to be acceptable 
POmtg404:724	S6:	 yes i would say that it only creates some information which can be or should be taken in account 
POmtg404:725	S5:	 so 
POmtg404:726	S5:	 so it's general credit in a sense not specific not speci- not specific credit

POmtg404:734	S9:	 er you're talking certainly about you need to know something about the quality of the program or the institution you need to know something about the level of the qualification or the workload you need to know something about the er learning outcomes ideally but of course they have to operationalized in a way 
POmtg404:735	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:736	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:737	S9:	 and you will also need to know something about the profile of the qualification if your recognition for example is for er acceptance into doctoral program now obviously for the recognition community having some sort of clear statement on the quality aspect of the program or the institution is a great help er it can be a legal statement in the terms of accreditation it doesn't have to be but if it's not at least it has to be erm but from our point of view i think it will be advantageous if it were something a little bit beyond saying we've assessed er this institution and we found this and this er it has to be there has to be some kind of conclusion as to the quality

POmtg404:740	S5:	 is there 
POmtg404:741	S9:	 that any degree from that institution is recognized in terms of any degree from another institution because that might depend on the level and th- th- the degree has to be of comfortable level er for certain purposes or comparable profile et cetera but it is a very important first step

POmtg404:748	S5:	 hm

POmtg404:763	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:764	S10:	 so er recognition should not be seen any more as an acknowledgement of a for an diploma and labelling it that it's good er it should be seen as as positioning that credential into the education or employment system of the host country hh or otherwise a very very primitive e- example demonstrates that it doesn't work hh if one comes back home and says oh yes they fully recognized my diploma but they could not find a place for it in the labor market or

POmtg404:859	S1:	 so yo- as you go to the yales and the stanfords they say this is not an interest of us because of course we meet the minimum standards we wish a system that identifies our excellence then not only do we have the processes but we are very good 
POmtg404:860	S7:	 hm

POmtg404:865	S1:	 and the point i'm trying to make is that's where the more traditional sort of quality assurance evaluation strategies do still have a purpose because in a sense what we report on is @ different levels of o- of of quality hopefully culminating in excellence in in some programs

POmtg404:869	SX-4:	 mhm 
POmtg404:870	S1:	 but i still unless part of this we can probably reopen as the discussion as we go into the [name1] follow-up so let's proceed i guess then 
POmtg404:871	S6:	 hm 
POmtg404:872	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg404:873	S1:	 is now yes the oldest network from ninety-two the [org10]- small but old er [S4] 
POmtg404:874	S7:	 @@@@@
POmtg404:875	S4:	 ah you stole my starting sentence that's not fair 
POmtg404:876	SS:	 @@@@@
POmtg404:877	S4:	 because as [S7] was saying er [org3] is perhaps the youngest i think then that the [org10] must be the oldest because we were actually er we had our first meeting in december nineteen ninety-two er at at er the danish initiative because we'd just been set up and we felt this need to meet with colleagues and and discuss our experiences of setting up quality assurance and er er developing methods i mean there was not a lot of people to to talk to at that stage but actually all the nordic countries had started doing either setting up national systems of quality assurance of higher education or doing pilot projects at that stage so that was very convenient for all of us to meet but we were a very hetero- -geneous group at that stage as well because er some of us were agencies and some were researchers and there were also ministry representatives so we were a a very varied bunch you could say hh er and we er er we set up a very informal network i i don't even think we used the term network er then we just decided that it would be worthwhile to to meet an- and talk about what we were doing and keep each other informed about the progress in in in our countries so for many years we just met once a year and we had this rotating er or this i- er principle of of meeting in the different countries er every year but then in the mid- er mid-nineties we started doing a a project together trying to explain what we what the outcomes of what we had been doing for the last couple of years er what the outcomes were and we we wrote our first project together and therefore it was necessary to meet on a reg- more regular basis but when setting up a network that was i think a good way of getting to know each other better because it's not until that you actually dig under the surface and talk about what you do explicitly that you understand your differences and your similarities so i think that was an a very important part of the development of the network 
POmtg404:878	SX-7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:879	S4:	 but the common go- the the most important goal of the network was then and still is to share experiences and discuss common issues of er mutual interest er to us all er in the nordic countries but er in the late nineties we we we had come to a crossroads so to speak because we'd been meeting for many years an- and it it was not necessary to stand up every time and explain that 
POmtg404:880	SX-7:	 hm 
POmtg404:881	S4:	 the danish evaluation institute is a a go- er a- an independent agency with a board and we do evaluations and so forth there were a lot of of information that we knew and we knew by heart and we could actually do each other's presentations so we said this is not enough i mean if we have to have a reason to meet and sharing of experiences is good but we also meet in in other circles we we want to to do more so we decided that we each year should have a common project along the lines that i jus- just mentioned that doing a project together enables you to have discussions at a deeper level that will enable you to to understand better and actually share experiences better so since then we have actually done erm a project every year together 
POmtg404:882	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg404:883	S4:	 er it's different people from the agencies that participate in these projects it's not on- the management teams or er one particular person i mean it's it's it's different and then our staff members also get to to know each other so we've done the a project on erm accreditation like practices explaining how we work with accreditation in the nordic countries we've done the mutual recognition we are just er in a few days i i guess [S11] going to er make public the latest one about student involvement in in evaluation is is almost ready 
POmtg404:884	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg404:885	S4:	 er and and some of these reports have er been er made public er as [org1] publications we has we have also with the years developed a process where we help each other to identifying experts because we have this privilege that we understand each other's languages er among the swedes norwegian and danes 
POmtg404:886	S7:	 hm 
POmtg404:887	S4:	 so we can use each other's experts and we all do that so we've actually at this year at the meeting in may we set up a more formalized system of of contacts persons er who to get in in touch with when we need to identify 
POmtg404:888	S7:	 hm 
POmtg404:889	S4:	 experts and then i think the last thing which could be important and interesting to er to mention here in terms of activities is that we have er exchanged staff for shorter periods for like a month or two month i think the longest was was three months so las- in two thousand and two we had a norwegian and a swede er swedish staff member visit either and one of our staff members went to to sweden and it's a very good way of er developing the competences er your skills your knowledge of your staff in that way i d- i don't think 
POmtg404:890	S7:	 mhm mhm 
POmtg404:891	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg404:892	S4:	 that you can buy the knowledge tha- that you can gather from your colleagues in any courses that are provided on the danish er market so that's something that we can only recommend er to do i think everybody 
POmtg404:893	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:894	SX-8:	 yeah 
POmtg404:895	S4:	 who have been involve- everybody who has been involved in that process have er has been very satisfied er the latest development then er because as you can guess now if you've been counting is that we started in nineteen ninety-two and an- and in the late nineties i think it was nineteen ninety-eight or nineteen ninety actually nineteen ninety-nine erm we decided that that we could not only share experiences we needed something more and then two years ago in when we met in norway we decided that we perhaps we should become a bit more formalized as we saw what was happening in europe and we decided that we should actually have a chairman a chairman on a rotating basis so the country which is going to chair the event the coming year 
POmtg404:896	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg404:897	S4:	 will have the chairmanship er so that's the reason why i'm chairing er the network at the moment because we're meeting in denmark in may two thousand and five and er the the fins had er the chairmanship er until until er may this year and er when we de- made this decision we also set up a web page er and that's a page on the finnish website 
POmtg404:898	S11:	 yeah 
POmtg404:899	S4:	 er on [org8]'s website just explaining the purpose and goals of of of the network hh but i- er we also have er the general agreement in the network that we are even though we have become more formalized we are still an an informal group er gathering and we feel that the representation that we need in terms of europe and in terms of of [name1] and so forth is er is well done by by [org1] that is the the the umbrella organization or the metaorganization in terms of quality assurance er issues and agencies in europe and and we'll meet for to er to to have a a closer group of of of sharing of experiences or developing ideas and it is er the spirit in in these projects come from our er common background as as nordic countries there's there's no doubt about that not from us doing the same thing because that's not at all the case but from being nordic and have a common understanding of of what we do and and and still to some extent based 
POmtg404:900	S1:	 hm 
POmtg404:901	S1:	 yah 
POmtg404:902	S4:	 building on some basic values even though we had a discussion about that this year i think that is what has been driving the the network so far 
POmtg404:903	S7:	 mhm 
POmtg404:904	S1:	 hm 
POmtg404:905	S1:	 the only thing i ca- er er i think i think the the the point where we have succeeded in the nordic countries is that it has been sort of er very intensive in terms of of ordinary staff i mean there there're a lot of get-togethers and this illustrious level we meet today i mean great leaders of organizations but but i mean we have a mechanism that makes er staff members familiar with other staff members that's er that's a very good part of it
POmtg404:906	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg404:907	S1:	 but of course part of this is costly i mean we i- in that sense i mean sending our staff members for two or three er months to another agency i mean is a resource to take out merely to gain this additional idea and feeling so it's er probably identifies the nordic agencies as x funding context probably some of the the the better the those who are able to afford that kind of er interaction any comments to er to [S4] 
POmtg404:908	S7:	 more a question er to [S6] because of your story do you see a kind of regional development within [name3] as well because i have the impression that the er er that there will be a sort of regional going together the newer countries the dach countries like germany sw- austria switzerland er flanders and the netherlands 
POmtg404:909	S6:	 yes 
POmtg404:910	S7:	 would you see 
POmtg404:911	S6:	 yes in fact i i believe that something might er lead in this direction in central europe in baltic states probably but not in the complete network
POmtg404:912	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:913	S6:	 because er the differences are quite high so so there are some more homogeneous groups as as czech republic 
POmtg404:914	S7:	 yah
POmtg404:915	S6:	 er slovak republic er hungary probably poland in some respect but now they have two agencies and they have some difficulties and there is er quite homogeneous er group of baltic states so

POmtg404:925	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg404:926	S10:	 er we started together in ni- in the ninety-four and when we were establishing the quality assurance systems then we worked together to have a relatively similar standards and procedures and we knew very well what we there was a committee that met every couple of months
POmtg404:927	S6:	 yah
