PRqas224:1	S1:	 thank you very much for your presentations i must commence on it erm there were a couple of questions raised i would like first that we take er 
PRqas224:2	SX:	
PRqas224:3	S1:	 ten minutes for an open discussion erm in the audience erm i i'm i'm er of course i know that this this won't be enough for all the questions but which is erm t- erm 
PRqas224:4	S6:	 yes er i wanted to to ask you two in particular of the last two 
PRqas224:5	S4:	 the last two 
PRqas224:6	S6:	 presentations yeah how do you think this problem of of translation also applies to interdisciplinary studies were they said how you use this terminology and concepts that arise in this that come from one discipline and yes are taken and apply it into another tha- that's the problem i- in the times you have framed the problem does it also apply to these studies or do you sense any form of i don't know s- erm o- of n- of concept b- breaking that is applied in interdisciplinary studies
PRqas224:7	S4:	 er it's a question to me as far as i understand yes
PRqas224:8	S6:	
PRqas224:9	S4:	 yeah should i
PRqas224:10	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah 
PRqas224:11	S4:	 yeah erm yes of course you know every er shift from every every shift er of the concept from every movement o- of the concept to the- to the other discipline of course you know changes the contact the concept my erm the er the the the the meaning of the concept that was not my point my my point was that of course you know it's the xxx 
PRqas224:12	S6:	 i know it wasn't you point but the point was to see whether you can a- 
PRqas224:13	S4:	 yeah 
PRqas224:14	S6:	 apply 
PRqas224:15	S4:	 can i give examples of this 
PRqas224:16	S6:	 yeah whether you can translate your point into interdisciplinary studies as well i know that wasn't the point you were making
PRqas224:17	S4:	 yeah 
PRqas224:18	S6:	 my er my my question was whether you can apply the same erm er er the same framework you use for analyzing translations also to the context of interdisciplinary studies 
PRqas224:19	S4:	 yeah so if i understand your er again your your question properly then do i believe in er like in erm e- er that science i- is international a- and er and the from this er i- i- if you if you are asking about that because then i'm not sure if we are understanding each other if yes 
PRqas224:20	S6:	 i- i know my questions are always a bit difficult to understand i cannot cannot yeah i cannot my que- yeah 
PRqas224:21	S4:	 yeah because because if that's the point 
PRqas224:22	S6:	 say it again
PRqas224:23	S4:	 yeah because if that's the point i do believe that science is international and i join [S3]'s er criticism of this er er interdisciplinary justification of gender studies especial especial i think that this is the guide and i agree with her i believe that er i believe that er er you know as latin used to be the king er of er er of of science er for many years we are now facing er the english language as a xx we have to face this i mean we have to face this reality we cannot er of course you know i'm very thankful to erm [S5] that er she er made this erm sophisticated comments er and i was not honest to her because in the in the in my er yeah in my original paper that i sent to her because i i have compiled this version of the paper just on my way here er i didn't have this erm er idea that this er translations can be somehow used can be very used productively i mean not only as an object of criticism they can be used only er in a very productive way and er they can be used as a erm as a com- as a as a as a terrain for er contacting the authors you know and so on yeah 
PRqas224:24	S5:	 do do you want me to comment on it
PRqas224:25	S6:	
PRqas224:26	S5:	 because i've okay i suppose i what you are trying to say is like whether the the i in in a metaphoric sense of the word translatability or translations apply to the different disciplines when we are talking about interdisciplinarity right okay so i would say above all that and i have saved this comment on x two in the morning i don't like the term personally interdisciplinarity what what i prefer is precisely because of the in my understanding this approach what i was trying to sort of like put together in a nutshell here er er concerning translations applies to to any concept when it sort of like travel lots of borders so travels across borders so i would rather talk about transdisciplinarity cos interdisciplinarity partly er erm okay how it is used now at the very moment in hungary in the context of hh arguing for changing the education system in line with the bologna treaty as if they were a patented version of it anyway carved in stones what interdisciplinarity has come to mean is like how to save the face if you wish of the old disciplines through being an advocate of an interdisciplinary approach which constant- -ly means like oh we still can do sort of like close reading of literary texts as texts okay like er er er er a semiotic analysis of a text okay if we link it up with well we could link it up with popular culture we could link it up with er visual representations we can l- link it with er whatever okay but always y- you you have got the literary texts left in the middle and all the other possible er scientific approaches comes to mean like c- to be in a complimentary relationship with the literary text adding some flavour to it so to speak but never actually challenging the identity if you wish of the text and through that that approach because everything is difference if you wish is self-contained within its own own borders so therefore i would rather say transdisciplinarity because that kind of leaves the whole thing leaves it open like which way eventually some new field of scientific research is going to emerge so if you wish my biggest dream at the moment as far as i can see now would be like no separate l- literary text analysis no separate er media s- m- m- media text analysis no no s- separate like institutionalized scientific field of linguistic analysis of face-to-face interaction but rather wha- what to do in the name of a social semiotics way you are er your vested interests lie in understanding the ideological investments of meaning production t- t- t- to be an advocate of that is @ @@ i don't know 
PRqas224:27	S1:	 yeah thank you any other questions erm 
PRqas224:28	S7:	 does this have power okay my my question is again to the translation panel and to [S4] in particular it's more comment on the question because you know i think er your examples are quite convincing but they are really cases which are very difficult and dangerous to generalize because i think this would happen with any translation from one discipline to another to from one language to another because for example i h- have my own experience when my text was translated into english a neutral translator is a naive translator and this is the term which you use and it think this is very xxxxx you have these x interpretations these you know new meanings which are invented and these sometimes xxxxx of the argument and misinterpreting er which er i even cannot judge because actually er you don't look at the you know er the words you look at the whole lexemes er whole semantic space yes a- and sometimes your i believe even that your examples cannot be er read er adequately bec- because sometimes in russian the word xx could be translated as reality and it won't change the meaning of the phrase i wouldn't i i don't have context we would have to look at the context 
PRqas224:29	S4:	 yeah exactly 
PRqas224:30	S7:	 so it is very dangerous to give this examples er because the erm erm from the er text it's one thing and the second thing that each happens both ways yes and not only well russians translating westerners westerners translating russians and it's not about east and west it's about how to 
PRqas224:31	S4:	 shall i respond to that or is there time to respond to that
PRqas224:32	S8:	 sure er what what you prefer either we collect questions and you answer afterwards or 
PRqas224:33	S4:	 whatever whatever your decision is 
PRqas224:34	S1:	 okay yeah cos to 
PRqas224:35	SX:	 @@@
PRqas224:36	S4:	 i will collect you know i will write down 
PRqas224:37	S9:	 my question goes to [S2] 
PRqas224:38	S8:	 okay then it's better to respond now 
PRqas224:39	S5:	 yeah mhm yeah 
PRqas224:40	S4:	 yeah thank you very much exactly and this is why i limited my er like terms just only to each other just to show you how different is and i could not give you the example why in this case real is not er reali- reality right because she was speaking about subjectx not about reality you know and er and er therefore every every er every comment on translation for me it was very difficult to find examples to find good examples for this chart simple one-to-one correspondence because of course you know you can say that in some in some cases agency can be translated as freedom of action but basically when erm this is one of those terms that are very er erm erm oh let me erm start with this there i have identified because i'm analyzing not only gender studies translations i'm analyzing now a load of translations because i want to know if it is the case in er in if it is the state of the art only in gender studies or it is the case of the art in er in any sociology co- er literature right now i have analyzed like word by word tran- word by word the translation of this famous book trust by xxx 
PRqas224:41	S7:	 mhm 
PRqas224:42	S4:	 a classical text on the on the trust issues and er er i have identified that the problems are the same agency again you know o- of course i'm not speaking about basic mistakes for instance he's speaking about a religious movement armenians and the n- naive translator translates this as armenians as an ethnical so it's not somebody who follow this er famous theologian protestant theologian but er armenians are as ethnical so he doesn't see the difference so this is what i mean by n- by naive translation hh but of course you know the er er erm the er so he want to say that er the the context arises from the from the general perspective not indeed not indeed for instance in many cases people er russian translators translate negotiation there are some concept er there are some concept that we don't understand completely you know the concept of negotiation which is missing in our i mean in our regular life it's it's the er it's the the society which is not very used to negotiation and there is a an explanation for that very often the concept of negotiation is just missed or translated as negation and er er and of course you know there is some freedom there is some freedom there is some area within you can move but also this area has limits you can move within certain limits unless the text becomes completely different yeah have you got my point yeah thank you 
PRqas224:43	S1:	 thank you there was another question and okay 
PRqas224:44	S9:	 my question goes to [S2] and er i'd like to ask about the initial part of your paper when you spoke about the problem you said it was fieldwork-based research i mean based on long-term sorry based on long-term ideological immersion in daily lives of of your inquiries and so i was er i was curious because it didn't really and this it was my impression it didn't come out in your presentation what did you actually get out of this er c- following the- them in their daily lives which is not as to my knowledge a common practice when dealing with research in this field n g o work and this it is more like based on structures and structured interviews or you know like sitting in a cafe or in a xx so what did you get out of the er the the the fieldwork experience as you say being er present in their daily lives and interacting with them the second point i would like to rai- raise briefly is the issue of er transnationalism and i have a erm a a few problems that the way you use it seems to me is more like crossing borders and you know like crossing national borders but that's as far as i'm aware erm of the the transnationalism literature that's that's not the the point of it t- t- transnationalism seems to be more er creating a a i say new social field which is based on forging relationships in two or more national contexts relationship of social economic political character which i'm not really sure if this is the case of of your erm of b- the distance of your of your research who who going to buy books and then bring them back to the czech republic so to er summarize the question what kind of use you make of the the concept of transnationalism and what were you what were your reason fo- for using this concept in in in this particular context 
PRqas224:45	S1:	 are they short answers to this 
PRqas224:46	S2:	 well no but i i guess they could be erm tha- thank you very much for this question of what i got out of being involved with daily life i mean i think that that's actually a pretty no that's not a short answer erm because it has lots of really sort of discussions about w- what type of information you gain from interviews versus observation also versus ex- -periencing to some extent the tacit sort of exi- existence i mean it's one thing to ask somebody what they do it's another thing to observe something that they do it's another thing to erm involve yourself somehow and none of these things i'm arguing he- i mean i'm not talking about objectivity but i'm talking about perspectives you know and like each of those things give you a different angle to look at the questions and so i guess that i could talk about later but cos i wanna t- i wanna touch on the second one but erm in terms of transnational i liked this point i thought that this was really good because i struggle with erm terminologies you know you've got international we've got transnational supernational and for me it's always been erm and you know a lot people use the word global right it's just another one because got it's all its issues and i feel like each of these terms has its own kind of problems i mean i do- i don't wanna say international cos i'm saying that that that in the process of m- m- of travel and moving erm something gets changed in its hybrid space so you y- y- international to me sounds like you've got bou- solid boundaries you know one one country and another country they have these boundaries and somehow these two people can't communicate right and then and so that's enough of it supernational implies maybe perhaps and i mean i think that they're all problematic but it implies some kind of er you know moving up moving beyond of sort of somehow creating something that subsumes national boundaries and doesn't necessarily isn't but isn't er changed and then there's transnational and i i used think about tra- when i used to think about transnationals and i thought about it like more like a supernational sort of thing because somehow you're transcending national boundaries erm but then i was thinking about it more in terms of you got the movement and you're moving and in the movement you're challenging boundaries and this is sort of what i was trying to get out of the issue of transnational that it's not it's not because it's not a simple a person is located in country x moves to country y picks up something and moves back with no affect i mean i'm saying that there's a there's an affect in what i'm talking about things are that people are changed i mean that things are changed so i i guess i would say that that's sort of the rationale behind using transnational but i'm certainly happy to keep thinking about the implications of the terms 
PRqas224:47	S1:	 mhm another one
PRqas224:48	S10:	 erm i would just like to ask er i saw [S2] you took notes after the commentary and we never actually got time to hear [S2]'s response to the commentary so if er there's still time i would like to hear that thanks

PRqas224:53	S1:	 mhm 
PRqas224:54	S2:	 okay i'm looking at them and trying to decide which one i i'll try to talk about i mean i thought that so many of the questions i mean all the questions that that you raised [S3] were really wonderful questions that need to be that i need to continue to consider that erm i don't have beautiful answers for you know for example why and how are eastern gender studies supposed to be different i think this is a wonderful question something that i want to look at in my work in terms of how for example czech gender studies scholars have posited this difference in their own work in czech versus in english there's some er there's a couple there are a couple of interesting articles about the difference x in some of which the scholars present their realities in the english text and in the cz- czech text you know and there they communicate to different audiences and something else comes out erm i wanna look at that a- also in terms of erm reports for the european union because then there's another sort of layer in terms of how these things are presented and the similarities and the differences so i don't have any answer for that but i really do think that that's a wonderful aspect i hope that i can erm erm do justice in my dissertation to some extent erm i like this question of who is authorized to speak in the name of er gender studies i think that this is a wonderful question as well right who becomes erm legitimated and who doesn't any wha- in what area- arenas are you legitimated because i think that you can see that some people are legitimated only in certain arenas so anyway again these are questions that i think i need to keep working on erm but what else oh yeah she had this great question that i'd been pondering and i i feel really kind of un- -comfortable answering it in some ways this what practical steps must be initiated for the development of czech gender studies erm on the one hand i say that one one part of me says hh oh god now i'm an now i'm an expert on czech gender studies right so like here now i have to say you know here now i'm compelled to make some proclamation about what i as an expert see as what czech gender studies needs right and so that makes me feel funny erm but on the other hand i i know that there are some things that could be done to reinforce people's positions in the academy even in on a practical level things like pay and certain structures that would allow people to erm more freedom to think as er [S4] says erm and er and i think that this is really important for er for building and building and building czech gender studies so i mean you know and i think that there are things that i would say that definitely can be done but i don't feel comfortable necessarily jumping home hurriedly into this you know and i have done this project and so now i can speak about what gender studies what czech gender studies means you know 
PRqas224:55	S10:	 mhm 
PRqas224:56	S2:	 so it was really kind of i i felt really kind o- i was thinking about it for a while but i don't think i have any more time to talk about anything else e u expansion is also a wonderful question that i hope i'll deal with right
