PRqas19:8	S1:	 thank you very much and thanks for being not too long with 
PRqas19:9	SX-f:	 @
PRqas19:10	S1:	 this er when we have four presentations i find it er really interesting and quite impressive to have er exchanges and have er xxxx er now there is plenty of time for er questions
PRqas19:11	S2:	 so when i was con- in conference visit the first time in european so you just sit beside and i enjoyed i by myself really enjoyed but er bilingual er situation or multilingual situation in europe is quite different from in asia yes 
PRqas19:12	S3:	 what are erm sorry 
PRqas19:13	S1:	 well go ahead yeah 
PRqas19:14	S3:	 i just wanted to ask what what are the nationalities at the university at the moment
PRqas19:15	S2:	 the nationalities the
PRqas19:16	S3:	 of students 
PRqas19:17	S2:	 the international students the moderate korean students but right now we do have al- almost er four hundred or five hundred international students from almost forty-five countries but we would like to really right now for example the foreign students they should go abroad for at least for one semester to the language if they finished xx x x go abroad or we would like to increase the number of unbalanced students that's why we encourage our fact members teach if the course is in english so the foreign students come to hear these things so one in the international campus we invite really distinct faculty members from the [name1] university to come to teach so let other students come and then have a chance to get courses from other fact members in the foreign countries
PRqas19:18	S1:	 yeah there is another question here
PRqas19:19	S4:	 er it was other sort of related er you have twenty-five per cent of the courses taught in english
PRqas19:20	S2:	 yes 
PRqas19:21	S4:	 in what language are the others starting to 
PRqas19:22	S2:	 that's kor- korean 
PRqas19:23	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas19:24	S4:	 so foreign students coming in can they take a full university program in english or they need to learn korean
PRqas19:25	S2:	 er that de- depends on so right now we increase at least one semester to take the the korean languages and then step by step so depends there are much of tailor-maded programs that depends on the their language proper or pro- -ficiency if they are good at english then they get direct take the course otherwise they have to take korean to be up to take some korean courses taught in korean
PRqas19:26	S4:	 mhm i had another completely unrelated question where in korea is your university is a er 
PRqas19:27	SS:	 @@@
PRqas19:28	S2:	 in the seoul the korean univ- yeah kor- there while there are three university in korea
PRqas19:29	S4:	 in the x 
PRqas19:30	S2:	 it's a but it's a private university
PRqas19:31	S1:	 any other questions
PRqas19:32	S3:	 how do er how do you relate to korean language and culture at this particular time
PRqas19:33	S2:	 yeah 
PRqas19:34	S3:	 do you see korean as in any way thr- threatened or becoming less important in the life of korea because of this internationalization
PRqas19:35	S2:	 or 
PRqas19:36	S2:	 erm non-necessary i'm the director of the instit- the institute of foreign language studies and recover the foreign language teachings the majority are taking english courses but still we er provide courses french german japanese and chinese and russia and spanish but three twenty or thirty years ago the most pre- preferred language it was french either french or german but right now it changed the chi- chinese and japanese are first and second and so are these so are the forces the french and germ- german and also how we to teach the korean so we teach x for it's against the korean at this moment there is a balance i think and then the reason we are doing this kind of thing is the major univ- major companies like samsung or xx they we haven't taught english really a lot of time since the third grade but we can we had digital xx real communication we have taught er not about english not english itself so we tried to provide a kind of english competence to increase the english competence @@
PRqas19:37	S3:	 are you er well you said that the aim was also to go to fifty per cent of the courses 
PRqas19:38	S2:	 yeah 
PRqas19:39	S3:	 x x x may have xx 
PRqas19:40	S2:	 yeah that's the president's xx president's 
PRqas19:41	SX-f:	 mhm 
PRqas19:42	S2:	 x x x x 
PRqas19:43	S3:	 yeah and 
PRqas19:44	S2:	 and then the way is the when they recruit new fact members the first condition is they should all the courses in english that's obligation mandatory one the new careers they should teach in english should be able to teach 
PRqas19:45	S1:	 yeah 
PRqas19:46	S2:	 their course in english 
PRqas19:47	S1:	 i am not afraid that it's going to go further and further and become upon totally english-speaking the rest 
PRqas19:48	S2:	 so and for me the i'm i'm also seen with the in- department in english and i'm teaching english ling- linguistics and listen i got pressured or it's time for me to fade er away from the stage @@@ because lots of new generation they speak english much better than i do so the young generation they they are really comfortable to deliver their lectures in en- in english sometimes i have that kind of pressure so how can i try to give my lecture in english and one month later sometimes if i'm good my english is very good and i feel comfortable but on other day i feel really frustrated because i could- i couldn't deliver what really wanted to deliver to them and then it makes me frustrated so old generation is really against that kind of xxxx and young generation they have to er they are forced to do of other things 
PRqas19:49	SX-f:	 hm 
PRqas19:50	S2:	 thi- this is this is now this korean situation 
PRqas19:51	S1:	 any other questions okay thank you very much
