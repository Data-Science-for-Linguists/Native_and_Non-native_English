LEcon560:1380	S7:	 i was in sweden like er half a year 
LEcon560:1381	S3:	 yeah

LEcon560:1388	S4:	 i'm saying as well 
LEcon560:1389	S7:	 i think the i think it's somehow easier cos this is i think the norwegian language is closer to to swedish than is spoken xx 
LEcon560:1390	S3:	 xx study norwegian er xxxxxx 
LEcon560:1391	S7:	 yah

LEcon560:1396	S7:	 but but do you do y- it's okay @ er do you understand people from from the north or the south from sweden more easily 
LEcon560:1397	S3:	 xx norwegian people tend to understand the the swedes and danish people better than the erm sorry @@ x 
LEcon560:1398	S7:	 but but is there a difference between like somebody from stockholm or xx and and
