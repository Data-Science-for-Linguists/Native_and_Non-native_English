phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes
a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this

a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
this License.

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(g) below,
which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in
unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered
an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of
the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of

not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.



3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:



to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and
to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including
any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has
been modified.";

to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,

to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and
formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor
are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights described in
Section 4(e).



4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:



You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute
or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d),
as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(d), as requested.

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms
of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either
this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
License (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable
License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with
every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License
and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in
the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
License.

You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any
manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted
works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to
be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in
con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section
3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

For the avoidance of doubt:



Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of
such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that
is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under
Section 4(c).

Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must
not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the
Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification
or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section,
to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make
Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer



UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



7. Termination



This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will
not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.

Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.

8. Miscellaneous



Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to
the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as
the license granted to You under this License.

If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.

No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take
effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not
granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
under applicable law.
