POwgd14:27	S2:	 yes 
POwgd14:28	S1:	 really so it's i- it's quite a lot of time and er er er you [S6] you will leave about in er erm half an hour or
POwgd14:29	S6:	 yes erm 
POwgd14:30	S1:	 something like that hh 
POwgd14:31	S6:	 early 
POwgd14:32	S1:	 yeah i would like to just in order to to erm share responsibilities to have somebody taking minutes or taking ideas so we don't lose anything then we can hhh er er at the end we could recapitulate what we have er suggested so to say er cou- could you [S7] please cou- could you be a little more precise in what we are not saying but what we are thinking perhaps @
POwgd14:33	S7:	 i'll try 
POwgd14:34	S1:	 a- a- as a whole that would be very very nice er of you 
POwgd14:35	S7:	 if not everything is registered 
POwgd14:36	S1:	 @@ no er we haven't got er we haven't passed through the cognitive program as yet erm er i suggest er er er that we hh we take the questions right like mhm as they are and and we go through and we have hh perhaps one er mo- more brainstorming section and we have no really no procedures very formal ones that we we say what we think and then we try to sort out for each question what is the hh sort of the main ideas what could we report afterwards hhh erm i think it's introduced the topics of the questions so we need not erm erm er give time to that th- the first topic the first question mentioned i- is the fields of study relevant er to the for the development of joint programs within the [org1] networks er fields of studies relevant for joint programs i i'll give the word free and er please don't feel er inhibited er so just speak speak round and i i give the word er wha- what are your your first er reflections on that o- o- on the topic yeah [S6] 
POwgd14:37	S6:	 my first reflection is to see that any field of st- study could be relevant exce- except to the decision of the academics to @ to launch something or not but i don't think that we could er choose or impose any field to to anybody if i'm better than you 
POwgd14:38	S1:	 mhm what more more ideas more hh er d- do you think this procedure is okay you don't want to
POwgd14:39	SX-m:	 x 
POwgd14:40	S1:	 split up in smaller groups now no no no it it doesn't it's okay like this huh hh erm 
POwgd14:41	S9:	 i think it depends on the activity of the people i mean x there're do x there are good initiatives er for some er field or for some program and there're good arguments and then it comes out that this is a relevant field for instance urban studies is a since we are the universities of the capitals sometimes somehow the natural choice and the natural er natural possibility but of course i also feel that it's mostly connected with er our wishes and our intentions and i mean the intentions of the people of the of the universities and the identities who are pre- participating in the in the in the network
POwgd14:42	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:43	S9:	 so these er examples we have heard yesterday is each of them has some characteristical reason which gives just this er possibility the good opportunity er er euro studies plus er urban studies are natural choices then you have some other some other examples who have just came out due to the needs of the universities who are happy to be together 
POwgd14:44	S1:	 mhm yeah please x- er [S4] 
POwgd14:45	S4:	 yes and i think also that erm we should have adopted an approach of letting the fields hh in which these er joint studies are implemented free in some in some fields we are receiving some erm er comments from the scientists from the teachers er themselves hhh erm for example in in some fields of sciences the so-called old sciences where the number of students masters and p h d level er is becoming very erm restrict there're very few interested er people in this er erm studies 
POwgd14:46	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:47	S4:	 and in those cases it seems to be erm er to it seems that a good chance would be to create erm joint studies which we er would er allow that within er an international cooperation the the low number of students would be shared and er so to increase the interest to increase the xxxxx and to to create a sort of er synergy we had some er er we we know from some initiatives one of er them is within for example mathematics 
POwgd14:48	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:49	S4:	 where the universities themself begin to talk together and saying oh when er we are er er having a lot of er er a lot large degrees of of students nobody wants to study mathematics 
POwgd14:50	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:51	S4:	 then in other cases we have er sort of of the erm very good er but very small er groups so particularly in the in some fields of sciences i think that this motto could give 
POwgd14:52	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:53	S4:	 er us a possible instrument to give xx with some some er er developments
POwgd14:54	S1:	 you you're talking about er er i saw er two factors the endangered factor so to say you have low numbers and you have to have a hh to have critical masses that is er one thing you thought you you said and the other one would be the the the strength no to combine strength is that the other 
POwgd14:55	S4:	 yes yes yes the two things are in some cases are are quite er er er 
POwgd14:56	S1:	 argument xxx 
POwgd14:57	S1:	 yeah you you you're little but you're strong huh
POwgd14:58	S4:	 xxx 
POwgd14:59	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:60	S4:	 yes 
POwgd14:61	S1:	 of course yes okay 
POwgd14:62	S4:	 x- 
POwgd14:63	S1:	 and you were x- mhm 
POwgd14:64	S4:	 because in x- some fields you have a lot of students even in the master's er level 
POwgd14:65	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:66	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:67	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:68	S4:	 but there are some er some er fields where you are 
POwgd14:69	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:70	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:71	S4:	 you can see from the numbers that the number of students inscribing 
POwgd14:72	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:73	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:74	S4:	 in the first place in this er fields or in this er directions are decreasing systematically because the studies are not modern 
POwgd14:75	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:76	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:77	S4:	 because they are not made attractive 
POwgd14:78	S1:	 mhm mhm mhm 
POwgd14:79	S4:	 another example would be chemistry there're some universities they ha- that have changed their 
POwgd14:80	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:81	S4:	 the presentation of their curricula to include not for example analytic chemistry and organic chemistry and so on 
POwgd14:82	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:83	S4:	 but to call this this lessons or this er this courses biochemistry and so on and then they they will receiving the double of of inscriptions so some some er fields are 
POwgd14:84	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:85	S4:	 have the problem that they have too er too er small number of interested students so
POwgd14:86	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:87	S4:	 if nearby universities or universities with with a similar erm er focus on their profile of of their the courses could join then they can share a group of x students this this a 
POwgd14:88	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:89	S4:	 erm objective could also be very competitive relative to other studies 
POwgd14:90	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:91	S1:	 attractiveness competitiveness 
POwgd14:92	S4:	 this yeah 
POwgd14:93	S4:	 this is only one one a er a further aspect 
POwgd14:94	S1:	 xx important 
POwgd14:95	S1:	 yah ah of course 
POwgd14:96	S4:	 er that should be considered er as a as a good thing of er the joint degrees
POwgd14:97	S1:	 yeah mhm mhm mhm mhm 
POwgd14:98	S1:	 yah yah circumstances er important er fo- for the for the the fields to be developed er er i very good er
POwgd14:99	S4:	 difficult xx 
POwgd14:100	S1:	 [S11] y- you
POwgd14:101	S11:	 right i don't xxx i just wanna say that i also think that there should be no exclusion per se and that small or 
POwgd14:102	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:103	S11:	 and or er endangered endangered er programs could actually benefit tremendously by pooling resources not only human but also capital erm for er to a certain extent at the other hand erm if you look at perhaps more established programs erm within the social sciences normally a fairly big programs there are a lot of what i was thinking is that that if x within some fields there're specific funding for these kind of opportunities perhaps that would er encourage er institutes or departments to actually look x even further within social science for instance you have the xxx er shares who get like a bust of money if they sort of 
POwgd14:104	S1:	
POwgd14:105	S11:	 do a program on political integration and and suddenly you have the xxx shares throughout europe and and perhaps they could more easily erm work together erm in as much as as they have to sort of x about the same guy in the commission i just wanna say that there are different ways that xxx 
POwgd14:106	S1:	 mhm i didn't grasp that of these share you said
POwgd14:107	S11:	 oh it's a european commission they they're a sponsoring erm some political integration shares throughout europe so that 
POwgd14:108	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:109	S11:	 if universities do a program in political integration they can actually appoint a professor er xx professor paid by the commission
POwgd14:110	S1:	 okay 
POwgd14:111	S11:	 er so just sort of to look into to to various sort of funding that might be 
POwgd14:112	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:113	S11:	 could be interesting as well
POwgd14:114	S1:	 yeah mhm 
POwgd14:115	S11:	 to encourage 
POwgd14:116	S4:	 and on the aspect of funding in even at the national level you could have er this this erm additional erm sort of of erm compet- competitive factor because for example in [place2] the e u have a lot of er possibilities of financing erm the students in their master's erm er phase and even in xxx also in the in the p h d phases and of course if you're there with the organization's funding this this er this level that the program has er a an international character er accepted within a a much er larger context this would be more attractive but concerning the the fu- the funding i think that this is a a problem for itself this would have to be discussed very carefully because a a lot of times the the funding of of students on their main phases of their studies is connected with the research
POwgd14:117	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:118	S4:	 so now we er yesterday and and today i ge- got the impression that the the connection of teaching and research was not er s- strong enough xx 
POwgd14:119	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwgd14:120	S4:	 yeah and so we have to xxx erm separately
POwgd14:121	S1:	 i put down here that th- this sort of er in this level er where really research and and and er erm the teaching goes together and and meet really in the first in the second cycle so to say in the master cycle the the problem of funding and financing er becomes er er becomes er acute 
POwgd14:122	S4:	 they meet together yes yes 
POwgd14:123	S1:	 so to say 
POwgd14:124	S4:	 yes 
POwgd14:125	S1:	 hh er good that was er a little bit of one round who who who else er 
POwgd14:126	S10:	
POwgd14:127	S1:	 [S10] 
POwgd14:128	S10:	 from er my experience visiting several universities in the past few months inside the easiest way to find er common project with another university is to think about already existing connections between laboratory you know if people know each other from er
POwgd14:129	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:130	S10:	 er work lab work or exchange of students for research it's much easier to take an opinion 
POwgd14:131	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:132	S10:	 to think about development of er program since in science you you need to have lab courses anyway
POwgd14:133	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:134	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:135	S10:	 so if there is no confidence between er people from er both institution it will be very difficult f- 
POwgd14:136	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:137	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:138	S10:	 to raise er a project and program from the very beginning er just choosing the field because it's endangered or er very er or could be very attractive for students if you haven't er
POwgd14:139	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:140	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:141	S10:	 this er first connection between people i think it will be very very difficult so that 
POwgd14:142	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:143	S10:	 our experience in with er brussels people in statistics for example already work together
POwgd14:144	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:145	S10:	 and for them it was just natural to say okay we will develop er
POwgd14:146	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:147	S10:	 a joint er
POwgd14:148	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:149	S10:	 program er immediately er 
POwgd14:150	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:151	S6:	 i er totally a- agree with [S10] er and even for for humanities and social sciences i think that the conditions are the same but perhaps er we could er envisage er an an [org1] er action er for to encourage er interdisciplinary erm master interdisciplinary activities or a joint activities in fields er where w- w- we have we are in the in the beginning of the the the knowledge 
POwgd14:152	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:153	S6:	 er er er discovery and er for for this kind of er er new er scientific area er we need probably to to put all the resources together to to be able to to launch something 
POwgd14:154	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:155	S6:	 but i think that in these two direction you could 
POwgd14:156	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:157	S6:	 er imagine something 
POwgd14:158	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:159	S6:	 to to stimulate er @ a dynamic er 
POwgd14:160	S1:	 mhm wha- yeah [S9] [S9] yeah yeah 
POwgd14:161	S9:	 xxxx science so i completely agree 
POwgd14:162	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:163	S9:	 but except xx and in addition i think that er the in er xxx so we could expect much more interest if we er connected this with the doctoral doctoral studies 
POwgd14:164	S1:	 if we conne- connect with yeah 
POwgd14:165	S9:	 yeah yeah because er this the- these er connections are usually based on the researchers on the on the x common interest in research so er of course this er tha- tha- this doesn't exclude the master degrees the exchange of students and common and joint programs but er 
POwgd14:166	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:167	S9:	 the most natural way to cooperate i think is at the doctoral level plus research in these fields and to combine both somehow and my second comment regarding the the endangered fields is these is not o- these are not only the fields in which you we have a small number of students i would just like to mention that in in my case of [place3] endangered study is a study of journalism for instance because we have a lot of ini- initiatives which are of a very low level in the region to establish the programs which are usually very er just at a low ver- low level of quality and it would be very much useful if we could er think in terms of one er good well er well-organized er program in journalism for instance especially for the region of of south eastern european xx i mean er wild west wild east whatever 
POwgd14:168	SX:	 @
POwgd14:169	S1:	 er w- wha- what i i gather from what you're saying is that we we have a a a top-down and a a bottom-up problem that bottom-up would be the normal way of of handling things huh er but the the question is put er from top-down no what could [org1] do for for stimulating hh things that ought to to rise from from the context between in the first place researchers or or academics er what would be the incentives we can come back to the [org1] fields now er later but w- what what could [org1] do you [S6] you said something about that er to stimulate that er the the laboratory are in in in in [place4] er makes contacts with copenhagen for example er er because this goes for everything no the context is is is the starting point for f- for joint th- things er er what could er [org1] do er [S6] @@ er as you see it huh from from this sort of er network point of view

POwgd14:194	S1:	 topic of of er of the fields of of er studies er erm w- what er erm if you don't mind what what i have in mind i- is that er er one ought to reflect a little bit on the sort of a competence if we join the universities in creating a a a a joint er program i think a very important aspect would be to create a competence that would not be created elsewhere no @@
POwgd14:195	SX-m:	 mhm

POwgd14:198	SX:	 mhm yah yah yah 
POwgd14:199	S1:	 i'll take the case er perhaps it's very er unrealistic er er that you in your country university has a very strong er er department and er and a special tradition in criminology for example 
POwgd14:200	SX:	 mhm 
POwgd14:201	S1:	 a- an- and you have another sort of social er social er surrounding that makes you study these phenomena in in a er different way as we do in [place5] or you do in in spain the- then putting together i- in a program that is erm erm er in the same field that you er er contribru- con- contribute with different sort of strength and traditions a- a- and er and competences to make a program that er brings about something new er 
POwgd14:202	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwgd14:203	S1:	 i- in one sense a competence that you can get elsewhere d- do you understand what i mean do you think that is er an interesting erm i think the the cognitive program is a little bit like that er that y- you combine er strong

POwgd14:208	SX:	 mhm 
POwgd14:209	S1:	 like for example er take the case of er energy er supplies or energy problems no hh take the problems of environment er that could be very interesting to bring about a master or a competence that has an input from very different erm areas i i would like to have that i noted as a a a a way or er a a path no what you say a a sort of er a modality of these sort of joint things joint programs hh er anybody w- wants to comment on that or hh make a wha- what do you think a- about the this sort of er this is not very because what i don't think is it really er er f- for my own sake is really erm erm er realistic and and a good thing that is to make what we can make at home make it several persons the same thing we have to make something new erm er in in one sense huh well d- do you want to make some more comments on what has been said or what you want to say erm o- on on this er er topic of of er of er fie- stud- fi- fields yeah
POwgd14:210	S5:	 yes i think an important question is

POwgd14:255	S11:	 put forward joint programs before other people can and in that respect it would be a added value for xxx perhaps but i'm i'm i'm not so sure from the point of employability that a student erm need to see there's a huge difference between the [org1] point er joint program or another if the student chooses the non-[org1] program it's all right with me really i mean it it must be up to the student where does the student get his or her needs xxx xx

POwgd14:323	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:324	S6:	 er schools altogether with a clear mechanism of a quality control i think that we could er be supported by european er organism commission or er of the science foundation because of the combination of theoretical and pragmatic approach because it's a it's a- -nother step towards other organism who say er we can test what we are er we can we could er organize some things

POwgd14:326	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:327	S1:	 [org1] emblem has some assets that are common for all the programs is that what you you about quality control about er hh quality of housing about hh perhaps a certain sort of mix of theoretical and hh erm er field studies i- if that is so hh what i'm erm er erm er pointing at i- i- i- er is that a sort of a measure that would be too er too mandatory or too er you understand er wou- would that be hh too narrowing things down and do- and not letting things go on freely to hh er impose a certain number of conditions erm i i think it's very interesting topic this some discussion erm quality of course but if in other aspects [org1] joint program would possess some specific qualities or assets or or er like a formula well [S4] you you you wanted er to to 
POwgd14:328	S4:	 yes i would like to make a comment on that precisely erm i was asking erm the coll- colleague [S5] which status 
POwgd14:329	S1:	 status 
POwgd14:330	S4:	 does er [org1] have and i think there's something it is something very very free still 
POwgd14:331	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd14:332	S4:	 it's a group of universities coming together more or less regularly 
POwgd14:333	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd14:334	S4:	 without any accorded statutes or so some kind so i have one one er hh basic problem also with the er when we are erm speaking about the the [org1] status and attributing the [org1] level and so on what what do- does that mean
POwgd14:335	S1:	 hh er hh 
POwgd14:336	S4:	 so if you you er er want to to to stipulate a couple of rules of standards hh 
POwgd14:337	SX:	
POwgd14:338	S4:	 er within which we are all going to work then you have t- to ha- er then i- you cannot say for yourself this are our rules and we are going to make this rules you have to have hh 
POwgd14:339	SX:	
POwgd14:340	S4:	 in the sort of minimal minimal quality control s- somebody from from ou- o- outside checking on your rules checking on your regulations on your objectives so that you can say okay and our work procedures are going to be er evaluated or accepted or something by someone er able to do that this er sort of of minimum of governance shou- should then in this case be be introduced because otherwise er you're saying okay we are [org1] we are defining this rules hh and you receive the [org1] level so what the second er the second point i would like to so this is s- some sort of of er er input for for discussion that maybe should be carried out or or not erm i'm not i'm just stepping in this in this er group hh the second point i would like to er to make is concerning is related with the added value and the comptetiviness of this joint masters and then degrees within [org1] and has to do of course with with erm the financing so joint degrees will cost all universities participating in them additional money in in some way even if they are able to adopt er existing curricula and er er locate existing er professors xxx and so on there will always have to be a sort of of common platform that has to be financed by everybody participating in the in the common activity 
POwgd14:341	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:342	S4:	 then you also have to think about how are you going to finance the students that have to be regularly exchanged and have to spend semesters in the in the other country then i don't think that er it is going to ha- we are going to create a a common pool of budget to finance these common projects so we will have to use existing programs and existing sources of money then in that case i would make a very provocative question what would be the difference for a student to go to paris within erasmus for example or going to paris within er [org1] joint masters for example

POwgd14:465	S11:	 of of for instance erm [org1] gets eventually five different formats and perhaps this task force then

POwgd14:476	S10:	 yeah i have a question 
POwgd14:477	S10:	 excuse me i have a question in this point 
POwgd14:478	S1:	 mhm yah yah yah 
POwgd14:479	S10:	 er thinking about is it the rem- the remark comment of er [S11] is it possible to have a real discussion about structures and duration for example er totally er in totally independent way of the project itself if we had yesterday 
POwgd14:480	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:481	S10:	 er two different format just because we had two different project whereas if we had third we would had 
POwgd14:482	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:483	S10:	 third format 
POwgd14:484	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:485	S10:	 and fourth fourth an- and so on
POwgd14:486	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:487	S10:	 er because when we began to discuss even in our institution between joint program between two er disciplines scientific disciplines for example er let's say er mechanics and er and electronics for example
POwgd14:488	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:489	S10:	 they found a format in when er for this system er and chemist discuss about another type of project xxx of format even er if it was in er the same er university er you know because you they just adjust to the public to the former er programs in a licenses and er joints bachelor degree er et cetera et cetera so i don't know if a task force could from the beginning find a format with erm all the projects of [org1] will er will enter even if it succeed in one case would it be a model for another project in another on another topic with other colleagues with other [org2]s and so on i i don't know only a question as many formats xxx but i don't know
POwgd14:490	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:491	S10:	 it was two of two xxx @@

POwgd14:506	S4:	 forever or in a in a certain implementation initial phase er a multitude of of of er er models but you have to define a minimum of standards and erm of poverty criteria
POwgd14:507	SX:	 yeah 
POwgd14:508	S4:	 because otherwise y- you will never be able hh to give the the whole thing a given profile 
POwgd14:509	S1:	
POwgd14:510	S4:	 and a quality mark and so on that is my 
POwgd14:511	S10:	 for me this is not a format of this one 
POwgd14:512	S4:	 this was is my suggestion yes 
POwgd14:513	S5:	 yah and this are the great ambivalences of the whole bologna process we are drifting between virtuality and try er and reality because and that first on the one hand let's say we need diversity and on the other hand we need common standards this is the rhetoric what does is mean concrete 
POwgd14:514	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:515	S5:	 in the everyday life and this is not so this program and perhaps we can start the sort of a final solution within the [org1] network yeah
POwgd14:516	S1:	 i have to write that down that er erm is important i'll find 
POwgd14:517	S4:	 well er can i can i make a small comment er 
POwgd14:518	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:519	S4:	 based on the tool of speakers' relations yesterday we had 
POwgd14:520	S1:	 yeah do that er 
POwgd14:521	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:522	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:523	S4:	 already a discussion on the language problem 
POwgd14:524	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:525	S4:	 for example that that i mean with with er that is what but er i need for example the as as a basic 
POwgd14:526	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd14:527	S4:	 rule of standard okay you had er immediately someone saying no no we don't need to to offer things in englisch or french or some- er german would hh be sufficient why should a portuguese or or er a nor- norwegian or a greek 
POwgd14:528	S5:	 xxxx 
POwgd14:529	S4:	 know to speak er german to to have a course in law 
POwgd14:530	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:531	S4:	 so you know that this for example this would be one of th- for me a very very er characteristic er item 
POwgd14:532	S1:	 hh 
POwgd14:533	S4:	 of minimum standard of course there should be offered in a minimum @@@ xx language or common language of some kind 
POwgd14:534	S3:	 perhaps that is because it's so difficult for us 
POwgd14:535	S4:	 that is what i i was kidding with with the standard minimum standard 
POwgd14:536	S1:	 but y- you mean that that would be for for [org1] networks would be some sort of standardization that we work with these 
POwgd14:537	S4:	 minimum that's what that yes 
POwgd14:538	S5:	 we need we need it 
POwgd14:539	S1:	 yeah of of course er yah hh i know [S9] er you you wanted a word er mhm 
POwgd14:540	S5:	 otherwise it doesn't work 
POwgd14:541	S9:	 xxx 
POwgd14:542	S9:	 yeah yeah this er 
POwgd14:543	S9:	 if i understand properly this is a xxx questions so much a problem format and er type of projects er in which er framework could be reported and so on hh perhaps we could have some standards on the procedure hh in the sense that er who can bring er the initiative with which er way in which way er through the through the x- through the xxxx and so on hh and then i- when it comes to the [org2] table then my question is er how others can join in which er sense in which ways this program how others can express their interest and their er their wish to to participate and again add er some procedures
POwgd14:544	S1:	
POwgd14:545	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:546	S9:	 so to to have at least some loose procedure framework in the sense that you can establish the rules of behavior in a sense 
POwgd14:547	S1:	 hm mhm 
POwgd14:548	S9:	 and then of course the freedom er in in should the freedom in choosing and er hh proposing the the the the contents of the programs curricula future curricula should be quite enlarged 
POwgd14:549	S1:	 mhm hm hm 
POwgd14:550	S4:	 yes they should

POwgd14:556	S1:	 er dwelling there between what would be er more standardized procedures and what would be the freedom aspect of it th- th- the erm hh diversity aspect of of things hhh a- and the- er th- th- i think that is the whole sort of balance really because if you have to put an emblem on something i- it must stand for something hh 
POwgd14:557	S9:	 mhm 
POwgd14:558	S1:	 and if something stands for something it must be standardized hh i- in in some sense hhh i think the the the the i- important thing is that it migh- might be very general criteria

POwgd14:565	S11:	 the slogan on the european union 
POwgd14:566	S1:	 hm

POwgd14:577	S10:	 standards we all give the unity erm er we will have er diversity in the format hh 
POwgd14:578	S1:	 yah i think the only thing that can be done from a central point of view erm a- as for formats is to hold er on erm hold out what has been done what sort of formers have been hh applied hhh and could that be of some interest
POwgd14:579	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:580	S1:	 to have hh as i- in the thing that [S6] er er gave out in french this morning hh you have an interesting this sort of different er f- formats that could be theoretically possible no @ i think wh- what are the experiences from [org1] networks in that sense hh not imposing only just holding out er hh can we go to the second one the structures and durations of programs at various [org1] institutions hh are they compatible hh erm i- if if we we er wha- what would be your your opinion on that er let's er define the question in the sense that we talk about er a a sort of master er level no hh could we do that erm master what is after the b a hhh and er fo- for the time being so to say how are things at your universities huh erm and what are your experiences as er regarding this question 
POwgd14:581	S9:	 er perhaps 
POwgd14:582	S1:	 [S9] yeah 
POwgd14:583	S9:	 again i would i wouldn't er erm suggest any any any any rigid er rules but in the sense if at the beginning some some task force group er proposes some program it could be useful to also to specify the structure and the and the the visible duration for instance one two three generations of students er should be or could be rolled in in three years and then with the obligation that after this period it comes again to the [org2] or board or whatever 
POwgd14:584	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:585	S9:	 to again reconsider xxx for the future of the program 
POwgd14:586	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:587	S9:	 and the structure in the sense again we should keep the freedom depending on the different hh situations but in the sense that er the boards or the rectors finally can have the opportunity to to reconsider to see how it's going on 
POwgd14:588	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:589	SX:	
POwgd14:590	S1:	 erm i i i i i thought th- what you the er th- the legal basis i- in in different universities wh- what the structures are at the moment no for hhh for making master programs at your university would that in some sense erm hinder o- or or be an obstacle for creating joint things huh hh erm er because what you were talking about [S9] i- if i understood you well er is about er hh the future programs and their structure 
POwgd14:591	S9:	 yes but what is my my starting point is that 
POwgd14:592	S1:	 yah yah yah 
POwgd14:593	S9:	 er starting with some program universities know 
POwgd14:594	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:595	S9:	 what are legal bases in ea- in each of of universities i mean when they already somehow suited the program into the legal framework of the different universities now we hh [org1] bo- er parties become a have some possibility towards this joint program 
POwgd14:596	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:597	S9:	 and thesis possibility should be somehow realized
POwgd14:598	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:599	S9:	 and then this is er er the contination of the story is just in this way 
POwgd14:600	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:601	S9:	 and er the [org1] body can reconsider after one two three years again this program and how it works 
POwgd14:602	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:603	S9:	 are we really interested erm assumption that all these er particular legal er legal frameworks in different countries different universities are somehow well well defined and and suited with 
POwgd14:604	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:605	S9:	 already took into account 
POwgd14:606	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah mhm hm hh yah hh some more er some more aspects on on erm this issue er er [S11] huh
POwgd14:607	S11:	 the way i int- -terpreted or interpret this question erm st- existing sort of study structures at our university is what the question referring to and i think that yesterday when we heard the status quo report er seems that almost every institution xx said yes we are gradually or on the way to introducing a undergraduate graduate er structure erm be it one or two years but still erm it it seemed as if 
POwgd14:608	SX:	
POwgd14:609	S11:	 structures at least were in place erm to develop joint programs and and duration's right then we'll have to it's most typically perhaps would be one year joint program and then 
POwgd14:610	S1:	
POwgd14:611	S11:	 erm its institutions offering two year and must then decide among whether it should be the first year or the second year and how they do it but 
POwgd14:612	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:613	S11:	 erm i don't see there should be sort of insurmountable problems 
POwgd14:614	S1:	 hh now how do you look at a- at it from er er fo- for the time being er is there any problem really to er develop because a a joint program can be very many things really it can be er er very loose erm er you can take a course at another university o- or you can make it very mixed up and you can have some very hh intense development of curricula er joint works huh hh so er er er are there's a- a- any any a- any problems that arise no in this sense fo- for [place5] i can't see any really but what is important for for my country is that a joint program must be also a national program hh erm er w- we have wh- what is joint is one thing but it must be considered hh a national program at our university in order to the students to enroll in the program hh to erm er make their credits and to be registered and all that stuff huh hh but i- in a program we have one thing coming up in my area hh if we say that er term three studi- stu- st- studies abroad 
POwgd14:615	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:616	S1:	 at er barcelona university that's okay then we have the full right to recognize whatever they do there no so erm that it must be anchored er or established as a national hh er er program th- then it could have some subtext there that it is a joint thing no developed wi- with er in collaboration with different universities hh is that so fo- for you too that erm er because a joint program doe- doesn't exist in the air so to say it must be 
POwgd14:617	S5:	 yes 
POwgd14:618	S1:	 it must be be attached er somewhere 
POwgd14:619	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:620	S1:	 how is it [S9] in in er you you you have a joint 
POwgd14:621	S9:	 we just think of it we are just establishing the le- legislation and i hope 
POwgd14:622	S1:	
POwgd14:623	S9:	 that very soon we will have the possibil- of course the accreditation procedure xx national er national level is expected in our case it is expected the accreditation as a national program 
POwgd14:624	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:625	S9:	 but i hope that er this will be not 
POwgd14:626	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:627	S9:	 could be the xxxxx obstacle bureaucratic obstacle hh er sp- er which er needs some time but i hope that er we should have enough er how to say er responsible people should have enough enough understanding to to take into account er damages of such programs in a sense the national aspect should be somehow 
POwgd14:628	S1:	 mhm mhm mhm 
POwgd14:629	S9:	 er done in the very in in the most efficient way not to wait for croatia or slovenia or swe- sweden to start with the program

POwgd14:631	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:632	S1:	 mhm

POwgd14:636	S1:	 yeah

POwgd14:638	S1:	 hm hm hh hm

POwgd14:711	S9:	 a- again i'm er er er er er many times you are xxxxx er very probably usually you have the part of the program covered by the local universities and then the second part or the last part the final part will be realized as a joint program and in that sense the logical way should be that could be that erm it we had a master program of two years at least one semester two semesters optimally two semesters sh- could be er a joint program of course we can make a joint program of a complete dimension but 
POwgd14:712	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:713	S1:	
POwgd14:714	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:715	S9:	 hh realistically i would say the more realistic way is to think in terms principle in terms of guiding study students in some special topic special er courses er special parts of the program when they are already finished they have finished already this er more basical introductory part hh so this is perhaps for the be- er for the beginning we think that perhaps in this terms usually thinking in terms of a joint programs to gather them when they start er er er er this is 
POwgd14:716	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:717	S1:	
POwgd14:718	S1:	 yah 
POwgd14:719	S1:	
POwgd14:720	S9:	 my x 
POwgd14:721	S1:	 s- s- s- s- so to make it er erm to make it really profitable no y- you you're talking about two years
POwgd14:722	S9:	 two years i think 
POwgd14:723	S1:	 o- o- o- one year at home one er specia- specialization abroad er an- and thesis work huh
POwgd14:724	S9:	 erm abroad 
POwgd14:725	S9:	 yeah and thesis work er and thesis work should be and thesis work specially er the doctoral studies should be the bridge which different er 
POwgd14:726	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:727	S9:	 groups different research erm communities or laboratories can can establish the cooperation in research x so much expressed in the master's degree but still hh the thesis work should have a think co-mentors and so on 
POwgd14:728	S1:	 hhh very good th- that would be relevant for the sixth stop er for the fifth question to as concerns the the doctoral level hhh shall we move on to the third one to the hh er t- is there an agreement as regards institution development strategies and criteria for quality assurance and control hh we have we have er er er er touched we have treated these er problems huh er quite a lot beforehand huh hh erm 
POwgd14:729	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:730	S1:	 how do you define them how you look upon the term institutional development str- strategies hh i- i- is that er so to say connected with er these topics hh er o- of joint programs in in in a speci- er specific way hh wh- what are your your erm hh your f- not feelings huh @ what are your your hh opinions about that but wh- what one could say no erm er and that's very theoretical that er a joint program hh with input o- of staff from foreign foreign institutions no and with some development hh could of course enrich the the the proper hh and the own department in many ways hhh so er th- that's a spin-off effect of of er th- th- th- the joint programs for example if i want to launch my department in pragmatics for example hh we are strong but we will be stronger no so then i er of course i i look for partners to hh strengthen that hh er that sort of competence we have in the department huh hh i- in that sense er er a joint venture could go hand in hand with what you want to make the profile of your department er 
POwgd14:731	S9:	 mhm 
POwgd14:732	S1:	 hh now we are talking humanities but erm that could be of course all over the 
POwgd14:733	S9:	 x 
POwgd14:734	S1:	 hh area no er wh- what are your your er opinions yes please [S5] 
POwgd14:735	S5:	 i think the institutional developed strategies concerning the joint degree programs should be linked with the competences in research
POwgd14:736	S1:	 mhm that's for sure hh that is very important i think 
POwgd14:737	S9:	 yah 
POwgd14:738	S9:	 yah and two things one is that 
POwgd14:739	S1:	
POwgd14:740	S9:	 then the best part for the of the university usually a- appear as er potential candidates to 
POwgd14:741	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:742	S9:	 enter into the collaboration the second thing is that er practically all these initiatives are interdisciplinary multidisciplinary hh in our str- in our case means that we are we have the tool the mean hh to integrate a little bit university to to gather people functionally gather people hh from different er departments and faculties 
POwgd14:743	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:744	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:745	S9:	 to join and to present this er common initiative as university initiative this is a very good this has a very good consequences and i- in the in the precious in the internal life of universities xx xxxxx so there are two xx which i think important that er the best people appear at any days and then this interdisciplinary effect which is important for the institutional europe 
POwgd14:746	S1:	 hh in what sense er er perhaps there were other hands waving erm er yah er [S9] in what sense er the interdisciplinary aspect of of er y- you mentioned hh would that be of importance for hh the institutional developments hh at your own university
POwgd14:747	S9:	 er er in my university as i already mentioned yesterday it er it has the burden of history are very much pragmatistic faculties are so so strong that we are hh we have difficulties to gath- to to make some hh synergy at university level 
POwgd14:748	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:749	S9:	 so we are now oriented to make some good steps good practical steps towards functional integration and 
POwgd14:750	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:751	S9:	 this is our way to gather people and to tell them look er let us see what we can offer hh for the for the cooperation at [org1] level or the [org4] level or the regional er university cooperation levels hh what we can er offer how do you have any hh already any any common interest any common co- or some particular connections which could be 
POwgd14:752	S1:	
POwgd14:753	S9:	 used as a common er common in- initiative this is just the way how we try to strengthen universities through their its functions and then by strengthening the functions somehow naturally also strengthen the organizational structures 
POwgd14:754	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:755	S9:	 x xx university and this is in the last few years and i hope this will be c- continued i- in the in the future hh this is our strategy to strengthen university through the real good initiatives it gives something new 
POwgd14:756	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:757	S9:	 and to re- and to recruit then a- again in this process the best people and to give them their chance 
POwgd14:758	S1:	 mhm hh yah hh yah of course that is @@ what we all want really 
POwgd14:759	S9:	 xx 
POwgd14:760	S1:	 er hh that is the internal side of it to s- strengthen up er and make er a sort of a functional hh integration of people able no to to create strongholds no really 
POwgd14:761	S5:	 er mhm 
POwgd14:762	S1:	 hh er good er and in that sense you have someth- -thing to offer to to to hh to foreign universities and then you have this sort of er hh synergetic effect of all that huh hh yah er do er er er as for hh these er aspects er hh of institutional development y- you have some more to say you you want to hh to yeah 
POwgd14:763	S3:	 yes 
POwgd14:764	S1:	 co- come on come on 
POwgd14:765	S3:	 er 
POwgd14:766	S3:	 reading this question is there an agreement er of the [org1] member institutions er we have to take care of the er legal aspects erm as we have discussed before hh erm we all er totally agree that we have er a need of common standards er but er as we have discussed before there are er different er kinds of er development er we in [place2] at the university of [place9] erm 
POwgd14:767	S1:	
POwgd14:768	S3:	 we here at the university develop er our erm 
POwgd14:769	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:770	S3:	 erm er fields of er study but er as er 
POwgd14:771	S1:	
POwgd14:772	S3:	 we have discussed er in some countries er the local ministry er has to accept or er develop er 
POwgd14:773	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:774	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:775	S3:	 the the programs 
POwgd14:776	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:777	S3:	 so we have to 
POwgd14:778	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:779	S3:	 take care of this er this aspect too 
POwgd14:780	S1:	 hhhhhhh 
POwgd14:781	S1:	 yeah yeah as we heard it's er divided in in in we who are sitting here er in some bodies er some er nations the the legalizing body i- is er national-wide in er in other countries like [place2] it's universities
POwgd14:782	S14:	 but but but still 
POwgd14:783	S1:	 yeah plea- 
POwgd14:784	S14:	 the question is apart from we quite agree with [S3] [S3/last] said about the difficulties in the legal situation hh but i think the question is erm can we can we agree on one feature for example being that these joint master programs er should be only the such where the university also wants or already has a research profile so that is we we want a joint master in european studies for example and we want to have as an accompanying measure er a research cluster on the same field for example this is this this would be maybe er one where one parameter where the where the member institutions could agree
POwgd14:785	S1:	
POwgd14:786	S1:	
POwgd14:787	S14:	 er that that this is an important feature of our joint degree programs that that they are 
POwgd14:788	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:789	S14:	 research-guided or that are that they are somehow er linked with research and that 
POwgd14:790	S1:	 mhm yeah mhm mhm 
POwgd14:791	S14:	 in the institutional developments erm we should not develop joint masters er in areas er where we are er weak in research for example or where we do not want to develop research so if we say we want to ke- for example if we say in at the university of [place9] we wanted to give up media studies for whichever reason
POwgd14:792	S1:	
POwgd14:793	S1:	
POwgd14:794	S14:	 because we are weak in research and so on then it would not make sense to create a joint master in media studies with other universities because we will not be able to contribute 
POwgd14:795	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:796	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:797	S14:	 er researchwise and then at some time the program will not be good any longer because it is y- you have don't have this interconnection with ongoing research so that could be one er one parameter of agreement or disagreement and then of course it is up to the and and this is then the the the practical day-to-day problem er for each institution how will they fit that into their national legislation institutional strategy and so on 
POwgd14:798	S1:	
POwgd14:799	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:800	S14:	 and the question is do we want to use joint degree programs as one of the instruments to achieve certain goals for example if we say we as [org1] universities 
POwgd14:801	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:802	S14:	 want or regard ourselves as european universities then joint degree programs is one means to achieve this goal of being european-wide visible er universities for example 
POwgd14:803	S1:	 thank you good hh w- w- we talked about that on the on the first er o- of the wh- what could be a sort of a a labelling idea for [org1] er joint programs hh a certain sort of of er hh erm opinion or what do you say a certain sort of strategy abou- about research er hh and the the the research contents of a program hhh erm l- let the other aspect h- here put forward in in C now is the quality assurance and control hh and er er w- we talked er at length about these erm issues hh erm do you have any er erm other opinion or point of view that you want to hh to put er put on the table so to say hh hh about quality assurance and control among the [org1] member institutions what er yeah 
POwgd14:804	S3:	 we need it 
POwgd14:805	S4:	 we need it 
POwgd14:806	S3:	 we need it 
POwgd14:807	S9:	 yah 
POwgd14:808	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:809	S3:	 for example we needed 
POwgd14:810	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:811	S3:	 but we don't have it 
POwgd14:812	S1:	 no hh what we were talking about was the sort of the er interesting balance between what could be in er the sort of er standardization er wha- what er a [org1] label would stand for an- and what sort of er i- i- intervening measures will be taken from inter- er er from from [org1] 
POwgd14:813	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:814	S1:	 as a network and the freedom and diversity of the 
POwgd14:815	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:816	S1:	 er popping-up programs hh a- and and er 
POwgd14:817	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:818	S1:	 i think we were agreed upon the that would be some in order to make something [org1] we would have to agree upon certain sort of very general criteria and standards 
POwgd14:819	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:820	S1:	 and perhaps something that could be said to be a [org1] formula
POwgd14:821	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:822	S1:	 but what that is that would be have to be developed in in a task force 
POwgd14:823	S14:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:824	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:825	S1:	 group perhaps in this [org2] 
POwgd14:826	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:827	S14:	 yeah the i think the the the the question in this context of course is er parallel to the bologna process the bologna process is basically a contractual process er where representatives of states do something of their own free will hh er we could sort of duplicate that on much smaller scale 
POwgd14:828	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:829	S14:	 if we could find agreement with for example the rectors hh that they would agree erm to give a- and i hesitate to say that but 
POwgd14:830	S1:	
POwgd14:831	S14:	 to give part of their sovereignty to some extent to the network that is they have to say for example we agree on certain quality criteria on certain quality standards and they give the power to decide or to check whether these quality criteria are met for individual programs to the network which will then have to set up some sort of instrument hh to do that
POwgd14:832	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:833	S14:	 er now of course er as you said these criteria will have to be developed they will not have to be too specific but still there will have to be certain standards 
POwgd14:834	S1:	
POwgd14:835	S14:	 to which the institutional standards of each of the participating institutions will have to adapt or they're already there an- and so on but hh but there must be some sort of procedure 
POwgd14:836	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:837	S14:	 er for the [org1] label to be given it can't just be given pə 
POwgd14:838	SX-m:	
POwgd14:839	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:840	S14:	 like that because then you if you want to protect a brand 
POwgd14:841	S1:	 hm mhm 
POwgd14:842	S14:	 you have to be able to communicate what are the quality criteria for this brand on the and in this way i think it makes sense but 
POwgd14:843	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:844	S1:	 yah 
POwgd14:845	S14:	 that will require of rectors to agree that these joint programs are sort of quasi-accredited by the network whatever that means in detail now but er 
POwgd14:846	S1:	 hm mhm mhm hh 
POwgd14:847	S9:	 er we already opened the question we mentioned the possibility to have the board hhh which would be responsible just for this brand of keeping the 
POwgd14:848	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:849	S9:	 level hh and then the question is er we have already the -[org2] [org2] and er can we think in terms of er recognizing er quite xx coming to the competence center [org2]- of the [org2] which is sufficient enough not to double 
POwgd14:850	S14:	 mhm you know we could integrate it somehow yeah yah yah 
POwgd14:851	S9:	 the function of the and this is the question which we opened but we didn't have the answer x 
POwgd14:852	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:853	S1:	 @
POwgd14:854	S14:	 no but i think i think er er i'm i'm 
POwgd14:855	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:856	S14:	 quite er confident that er organizationally speaking it could be integrated into the [org2] but of course this is a political question 
POwgd14:857	S9:	 yes 
POwgd14:858	S14:	 within the network that will have to be solved on the political in the political arena and then we can we can do the operative work without er hh 
POwgd14:859	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:860	S14:	 er i hope too many problems 
POwgd14:861	S1:	 hhh 
POwgd14:862	S11:	 really also i i fully agree that political level not necessarily need to take decision on that 
POwgd14:863	S1:	
POwgd14:864	S11:	 but as looking at [org5] or or or any national erm quality assurance agency that plenty of of experience without er having best practices and and of course to some extent there must be a system of both accreditation of a new program once the program is running there's supposed to be internal external erm 
POwgd14:865	S1:	
POwgd14:866	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:867	S14:	 evaluation 
POwgd14:868	S11:	 evaluation and perhaps you can all this er what do i now mean the- there are plenty of of of ways conceiving a a fairly er respectable quality assurance scheme xx xx 
POwgd14:869	S14:	 hm 
POwgd14:870	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:871	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:872	S14:	 which will then sort of of course erm er work back into the participating institutions and m- might serve as a model for other er for other 
POwgd14:873	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:874	S14:	 curricula and their assessment or their evaluation in fact 
POwgd14:875	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:876	S1:	 mhm yeah hh yeah we were er erm treating these aspects erm erm i- in the sense we are talking now mo- more or less and we talked er also about the hh that [org1] as a network would be of er hh of course o- o- of interest in spreading hh spreading the the ongoing things huh hh and er formulas having been put in practice hh and could have some ideas about the procedures of entering er d- t- to make these erm er joint programs hh er being in in in in function to make them accessible fo- for others what sort of procedures would there be er within [org1] if it's a [org1] label joint program no hhh erm d- do we have yeah 
POwgd14:877	S14:	 now 
POwgd14:878	S1:	 er 
POwgd14:879	S14:	 w- we we don't have we don't have any procedures in place as yet 
POwgd14:880	S1:	 yeah mhm 
POwgd14:881	S1:	 no no mhm 
POwgd14:882	S14:	 so er what i would be interested in of course is your ideas of what such procedures might look like we we started discussing it yesterday hh 
POwgd14:883	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:884	S14:	 when we talked about institutional autonomy and er thinking that it would not be wise for the network er to say that you must stick exclusively to network members hh erm because er that might go against quality 
POwgd14:885	S1:	 hm mhm 
POwgd14:886	S14:	 and there're maybe non-capital cities' universities with a very good er research group in one particular field that it would be 
POwgd14:887	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:888	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:889	S14:	 it would be stupid i think er to say that they are not allowed to join the consortium
POwgd14:890	S1:	
POwgd14:891	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:892	S14:	 but we might want to me- we might want to define the thematic leadership of er er of [org1] universities in such a consortium and we'll might have to make that a bit more precise 
POwgd14:893	S9:	
POwgd14:894	S1:	 mhm mhm hm 
POwgd14:895	S14:	 erm bu- but i think these are things that that tha- i'm i'm expecting a number of also requests 
POwgd14:896	SX:	
POwgd14:897	S14:	 from the working groups to the [org1] leadership 
POwgd14:898	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:899	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:900	S14:	 of things that that you want to be worked out and discussed and played back to you for further for further discussion 
POwgd14:901	S1:	 mhm hm 
POwgd14:902	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:903	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:904	S14:	 this is part of the [org2]- of the [org2] idea
POwgd14:905	S1:	 yah mhm hm 
POwgd14:906	S1:	 hh oh that would be if if er a a a board would be created or this handing over some competences hh from universities to [org1] what would th- these be really no and and what would be the hh competence or authority of a a board created er in [org1] hh to authorize that labelling a- and and below that 
POwgd14:907	S3:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:908	S1:	 er which sort of criteria would be hhh would be er relevant and er er which body would would develop these criteria perhaps the [org2] to turn back to the 
POwgd14:909	S14:	 mhm 
POwgd14:910	S1:	 rectors' conferences hh er conference er shall we go on f- move on to the fourth er er er perhaps it's er er er mo- er more or less it's er it's er er we we have erm been talking about new or existing ones erm hh curricula programs link existing ones or create new curricula is that a dichotomy that is okay or or wha- what do you think about this question @@@@
POwgd14:911	S3:	 well this is a question of erm human resources and er a question of money erm if we develop new curricula here at the university of [place9] erm we have to pay er the new scientific staff or we have er to tell the old scientific staff hh er to erm er to hold lessons er in the new curricula so maybe er they will say but then the old curricula er don't work you we have to read in the new ones 
POwgd14:912	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:913	S3:	 so this is a it's a matter of money and er and of human resources
POwgd14:914	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:915	S1:	 hh mhm 
POwgd14:916	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd14:917	S1:	 well er [S11] er mhm 
POwgd14:918	S11:	 er there's both practical aspect and then i i'd it is also the academic er standards so to speak erm if if one partici- -pating partner hh feels that the curricula is really good and and can either easily be adapted or or or simply just turned into the next level that xxx a joint program i don't think it should be entirely up to the consortium of of people looking at each others' curricula 
POwgd14:919	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:920	S11:	 deciding on should we develop new or can we fit the existing i mean 
POwgd14:921	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:922	S11:	 it it it's difficult to say 
POwgd14:923	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd14:924	S11:	 erm in advance really what's 
POwgd14:925	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:926	S11:	 what's wh- what should be done
POwgd14:927	S4:	 hm it will often depend on the on the direction of the of the author if it is scientifically focused and well-established or if it is something interdisciplinary 
POwgd14:928	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:929	S4:	 xx 
POwgd14:930	SX-1:	 hm 
POwgd14:931	S4:	 that xxx
POwgd14:932	S9:	 this is usually the combination of an existing 
POwgd14:933	S4:	 case by case 
POwgd14:934	S9:	 existing topics and something new hh so this is a conti- continuing process 
POwgd14:935	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:936	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:937	S4:	 yes 
POwgd14:938	S3:	 yah 
POwgd14:939	S9:	 the question is a little bit er 
POwgd14:940	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:941	S9:	 hh er oriented towards something which is perhaps not very much present in the real life hh you have some structure which is a good usually and then you have some new moments new people new methods new

POwgd14:1272	S5:	 i think one of the main question is if in the future the doctorate is the first step to an academic career
POwgd14:1273	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:1274	S5:	 if it will be well for those who don't follow an academic career we must have special programs and this is haeh

POwgd14:1276	S5:	 if i don't need the doctorate to make a career
POwgd14:1277	S9:	 yah 
POwgd14:1278	S5:	 but i need 
POwgd14:1279	S1:

POwgd14:1281	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:1282	S5:	 special competences 
POwgd14:1283	S1:	 mhm

POwgd14:1287	S5:	 bei [org6] or wherever 
POwgd14:1288	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1289	S5:	 xxxx and the doctorate 
POwgd14:1290	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd14:1291	S5:	 is important for the academic career because you don't 
POwgd14:1292	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1293	S5:	 we'll have perhaps into the future not the habilitation also 
POwgd14:1294	S1:	 no 
POwgd14:1295	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1296	S1:	 mhm

POwgd14:1299	S5:	 yah
POwgd14:1300	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1301	S5:	 do i need a p h d in the classic sense

POwgd14:1309	S5:	 what the function of the doctorate will be in the future
POwgd14:1310	S1:	 the function of the p h d

POwgd14:1312	S4:	 yes
POwgd14:1313	S5:	 yeah
POwgd14:1314	S1:	 aha 
POwgd14:1315	S4:	 in the context of of 
POwgd14:1316	S1:	 aha aha 
POwgd14:1317	S9:	 we me- mentioned that they mentioned yesterday in [place3] we thought about it 
POwgd14:1318	S4:	 xxx 
POwgd14:1319	S9:	 and we realized that er this very problem there is no need there will be no need to have a massive doctoral standard for my studies and that is why we er
POwgd14:1320	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1321	S9:	 propose to have two possibilities one is doctoral studies for the scientific career 
POwgd14:1322	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1323	S9:	 and another is special- specialization studies special for many things for instance at engineering 
POwgd14:1324	S9:	 yah 
POwgd14:1325	S9:	 in which er in one or two years hh er the student can get additional knowledge additional skills and the competences 
POwgd14:1326	SX-1:	 hm 
POwgd14:1327	S9:	 with a certificate 
POwgd14:1328	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1329	S9:	 which is just er higher high- highest level of high level of continuing education in a sense that we hope that er doctoral studies will have erm er of course so 
POwgd14:1330	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1331	S9:	 there is no need to go to doctoral studies if you do not need them 
POwgd14:1332	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1333	S9:	 but there are many 
POwgd14:1334	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1335	S9:	 other things you er you should continue 
POwgd14:1336	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1337	S1:	
POwgd14:1338	S9:	 to to learn and this is why we taught in this aba- er er within this model two possibilities
POwgd14:1339	S1:	
POwgd14:1340	SX-4:	 yah 
POwgd14:1341	SX:	 x 
POwgd14:1342	S9:	 this two type of studies could be somehow an example for another depending on the 
POwgd14:1343	S1:	 hhh 
POwgd14:1344	S9:	 on the subjects but in 
POwgd14:1345	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1346	S9:	 in in in principle we 
POwgd14:1347	S1:	
POwgd14:1348	S9:	 like to have two edits 
POwgd14:1349	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:1350	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1351	S9:	 two type of edits from the third level of the bologna scheme 
POwgd14:1352	S4:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1353	S5:	 but this is important to develop joint degree programs 
POwgd14:1354	S9:	 joint degree 
POwgd14:1355	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1356	S1:	 mhm hhh some more about er the doctoral level hh of course you y- y- you can er you can id- invent a doctoral program that is er er just specific for that er sort of of er joint er joint erm er doctoral erm er agreement no hhh er for example y- you have a a doctor at in in erm er urbanistic studies huh and you have these universities er er collaborating in in in in in that sense hh and you have tha- that sort of of er hh program that is er hh n- not sponsored but it is er backed up by [org1] hh could that be of interest for [org1] hh to er host or to erm encourage these sort of of developments hh to have a a unique er new doctoral grade so to say no or or n- not grade doctoral erm program 
POwgd14:1357	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1358	S1:	 because in my country for example y- you you can't be hh to be a doctor you must be a doctor in physics or in hh you understand i- in in in all the hh er subject areas that are accepted as doctoral subject areas hh and given by a certain amount of universities having that accreditation for giving the the doctoral degree in certain areas hhh we couldn't invent something new hh in that sense hh then of course the person in the er in sociology could could make a thesis that is very much interdisciplinary er th- th- no problem huh
POwgd14:1359	SX-m:	 hm 
POwgd14:1360	S1:	 hh but we we m- must be doctors in sociology for example in mathematics or whatever how are things in in in your hh countries in that sense an- and how could er when we talked erm i talked about multilingualism i er er th- thought about that to be a a an umbrella thing now for different students coming from er different er subjects 
POwgd14:1361	SS:	 yeah mhm 
POwgd14:1362	SX:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1363	S1:	 but interested in one sort of aspect of of languages in contact er and and and and sharing course programs
POwgd14:1364	SX:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1365	S1:	 but wh- what are your erm er point of view on er this er topic of how is it in your countries
POwgd14:1366	S1:	 cou- 
POwgd14:1367	S9:	 er we have a greater greater pressure from the people who are opening er that initial er interdisciplinary programs what will be the title of our diploma xx doctor of physics or doctor of biophysics or doctor of and then er er this is open i mean this is usually a question at a moment the minister he decides er from case to case what to do but in principle the international council will be responsible to be elastic enough to recognize new interdisciplinary x multidisciplinary areas and to react by giving er solutions in the sense of the most appropriate mo- most appropriate diplomas and titles of diplomas
POwgd14:1368	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1369	S9:	 so this is the open this is 
POwgd14:1370	S1:	 is quite open question
POwgd14:1371	S9:	 quite open question because when you start to to 
POwgd14:1372	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1373	S9:	 to create new and new interdisciplinary programs and activities then you're of course opening this question you cannot just 
POwgd14:1374	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1375	S9:	 put doctoral thesis okay
POwgd14:1376	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1377	S9:	 you you should have much wider scope 
POwgd14:1378	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1379	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1380	S9:	 framework in which you can er react you can give something xx this is just our 
POwgd14:1381	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1382	S9:	 our our hope that er in the future it will be organized in dynamic way you cannot 
POwgd14:1383	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1384	S9:	 stratify fifty diploma titles and it's all you have to 
POwgd14:1385	S1:	 mhm yah 
POwgd14:1386	S9:	 move to react to the real life
POwgd14:1387	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1388	S1:	 but universities make suggestions ministry decide
POwgd14:1389	S9:	 yes 
POwgd14:1390	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1391	S1:	 okay 
POwgd14:1392	S9:	 er no national council should decide a- and this is again the body which is then

POwgd14:1403	S4:	 areas or er yes 
POwgd14:1404	S3:	 yah yah 
POwgd14:1405	S4:	 so about interdisciplinarity i can there is nothing

POwgd14:1500	S4:	 i think that at a at a doctoral level any initiative would would have to to reach the outstanding level 
POwgd14:1501	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1502	S4:	 the excellence level because at the national scenario the all our national levels 
POwgd14:1503	S1:	
POwgd14:1504	S4:	 already the 
POwgd14:1505	S1:	
POwgd14:1506	S4:	 qual- the usually the quality of of this level is quite high this is already the level hh er which 
POwgd14:1507	S1:	 hm 
POwgd14:1508	S4:	 is able to acquire a lot of er funding in er in international peer-review systems er funding systems hh in international context hh er this is also already the level very er pretty much in competition in er in er being attractive genu- er enough to er to receive foreigner students coming from all over the ca- er the place ready having a lot of instruments to to be attractive for foreign students
POwgd14:1509	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1510	S4:	 so erm independent of of erm what we are going to develop on that this level it would have to have outstanding quality to be competitive

POwgd14:1518	S1:	 yah what i think in in doctor levels the er th- the small based subjects it is even more important no for them to collaborate
POwgd14:1519	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1520	S4:	 yes
POwgd14:1521	S1:	 th- th- they

POwgd14:1525	S4:	 xx 
POwgd14:1526	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1527	S1:	 papyrus er subject and so on here it is absolutely and i suppose that they are collaborating of course because it's 
POwgd14:1528	S4:	 yes they have to 
POwgd14:1529	S1:	 integrated with the research an- and so on er but the same question as we made before would be made at this level in in what areas would er collaboration be able to to create critical mass and strengthen er small subjects so to say not small but very specific and strong competences but small ones in one sense couldn't that be the question er to to the rectors
POwgd14:1530	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1531	S1:	 to try to to single out er i- i- in what areas would er combined research and doctoral programs be of interest to hold up no and to maintain something that is perhaps er very small in numbers so to say
POwgd14:1532	S4:	 but also there i would er let it open to all fields
POwgd14:1533	S5:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1534	S4:	 because you can have that approach hh but another approach 
POwgd14:1535	S1:	 mhm mhm 
POwgd14:1536	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1537	S4:	 because you are so strong and that everything is so actual an- and er 
POwgd14:1538	S1:	 yah yah 
POwgd14:1539	S4:	 hh you know erm outstanding technology and future er that can also be precisely the the the reason to get together so i would 
POwgd14:1540	S1:	 mhm 
POwgd14:1541	S4:	 let also here open to all fields and all and open to different approaches and 
POwgd14:1542	S5:	 yah 
POwgd14:1543	S4:	 different motivations because you can have dependent on the fields have different approaches 
POwgd14:1544	S9:	 yah you this 
POwgd14:1545	S4:	 this would be 
POwgd14:1546	S9:	 here is important to have bottom-up approach because you should have already some xxxx some previous collaborations or some contacts which can give the basis for 
POwgd14:1547	S4:	 the basis yes yes yes yes 
POwgd14:1548	S9:	 for the next steps and for rectors it is important to know where are the spots which are candidates for the future collaborations
POwgd14:1549	S1:	 very good hh so we acclaim the sort of the idea o- of er hh continuing hh collaborating on the doctoral level well the the fifth issue no hhh 
POwgd14:1550	S9:	 yah
