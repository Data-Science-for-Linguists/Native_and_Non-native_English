1. Contents
-----------

This directory contains plain text (TXT) files derived from the XML
version of the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English
(VOICE). The files correspond to the edition of VOICE XML indicated by
the name of the parent folder (i.e. VOICE1.0XML or VOICE1.1XML). The
derived TXT version of VOICE is provided only for users'
convenience. It is similar to the output format 'plain style' provided
in the VOICE Online interface (http://voice.univie.ac.at), that is, it
renders a reduced version of the transcript for easy readability
without tags and mark-up, also excluding features such as uncertain
transcription, emphasis, intonation, and lengthening. Please note that
the XML version of VOICE (and hence the corpus files provided in the
folder XML) is to be considered the main point of reference, since it
comprises all annotation layers available in VOICE.
