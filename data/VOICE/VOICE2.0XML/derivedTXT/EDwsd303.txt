EDwsd303:172	S17:	 but i on the point of american english used as lingua franca i think that if we try to define english as a lingua franca we can u- er use two approaches first to define english and then lingua franca so english can be either british english american english or some other kind of english australian and so on
EDwsd303:173	S1:	 okay

EDwsd303:175	S17:	 and lingua f- lingua franca for me can be a language that is erm not necessarily english that is used between er interwalk- interlocutors c- coming from different grounds and who have who have er different mother tongues so this is a language which both interword- interlocutors can use but lingua franca can also be not a specific language but some kind of artificial language for example in scandinavia they have this skandinaviska right so which is little swedish little danish and little norwegian but er the three nations can understand each other am i right

EDwsd303:290	S23:	 part of the world maybe it's spanish in latin america for instance but i think that english is kind of unique it's not like usual lingua franca cos lingua franca it's everywhere in just in small territories but 
EDwsd303:291	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:292	S23:	 english is like we we can't say that it's a global language 
EDwsd303:293	SX-f:	 hh 
EDwsd303:294	S17:	 in xx 
EDwsd303:295	S1:	 but can you then maybe 
EDwsd303:296	S23:	 it's no just xx x 
EDwsd303:297	S12:	 chinese is the most spoken language
EDwsd303:298	S1:	 sorry 
EDwsd303:299	S23:	 but in and xx xx 
EDwsd303:300	S1:	 can you can you maybe then give your definition of lingua franca again only not as english but only 
EDwsd303:301	S23:	 no i i i i i gave the what the like my of ling- lingua franca 
EDwsd303:302	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:303	S23:	 is like er the international tool for is like a auxiliary tool for international communication between people with different backgrounds 
EDwsd303:304	S1:	 okay 
EDwsd303:305	S23:	 and a certain territory
EDwsd303:306	S1:	 okay
EDwsd303:307	S23:	 but i want to obje- my objection is that english is not just usual lingua franca that was the definition of lingua franca not english as a lingua franca
EDwsd303:308	S1:	 yeah no exactly
EDwsd303:309	S1:	 thank you anybody want to react to this yeah 
EDwsd303:310	S24:	 i didn't want to react i just wanted to ask er er why are why should we talk only about lingua franca wasn't the topic er english as lingua franca 
EDwsd303:311	S1:	 hh but i think it's important to clarify the concepts 
EDwsd303:312	S24:	 maybe we shouldn't 
EDwsd303:313	S1:	 before we move on that we all know what we mean by lingua franca because obviously there are differences 
EDwsd303:314	S24:	 yeah i just thin- erm think about that er okay i agree we just yeah what is it but er should we think about other languages because yes i agree that the other languages can be a lingua franca too but we are talking now about english 
EDwsd303:315	S1:	 hh i think i- 
EDwsd303:316	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:317	S1:	 but i think at this moment erm we have to try to only do it on an abstract level just for now for the next five ten minutes then we can move on to english or any other language which might come up but for now only the concept does anybody disagree 
EDwsd303:318	S21:	 yeah 
EDwsd303:319	S1:	 with his view okay 
EDwsd303:320	S21:	 @ er if you look at the history maybe y- you will find some differences between the er xxx biased they w- they were inside every country ruling the country the and the er u s a xx not er erm by they end up over the world ruling everywhere they have a xxx economical power and they are more or less ruling some countries but they rule only in the united states and then they have many er economical links so they they don't have they er all the world is not speaking in english like the first as a first language but yeah er they do as a second because erm is the best way to communicate they are investing lots of money in it 
EDwsd303:321	S1:	 thank you did you understand what he said 
EDwsd303:322	S24:	 er 
EDwsd303:323	S24:	 yes i think so do you want me to explain
EDwsd303:324	S1:	 okay you want 
EDwsd303:325	S1:	 yes please 
EDwsd303:326	S24:	 er er i think what he was saying is that erm english is not you were t- talking about a special kind of lingua franca and what he was trying to say is that in other times er some ancient er powers like erm were using also a ki- er a common language english is not different just because today er his pow- er his power is greater or you can see it better er for example we had french we had german 
EDwsd303:327	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd303:328	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:329	S1:	 but please let let me take a step back
EDwsd303:330	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:331	S1:	 first to the concept lingua franca and then we move on to the political historical language 
EDwsd303:332	S17:	 may i raise a question 
EDwsd303:333	S1:	 x 
EDwsd303:334	S24:	 i think 
EDwsd303:335	S1:	 sorry you you want to pose a question
EDwsd303:336	S17:	 yes are we going to talk about lingua franca as a language that is known by both persons who want to communicate or some kind of artificial language i mean that is not the pure language er of a certain nation
EDwsd303:337	S1:	 that's a good point 
EDwsd303:338	S18:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:339	S24:	 xxx language we try xx 
EDwsd303:340	S1:	 yeah can you can you 
EDwsd303:341	S8:	 er that was actually er wha- what i just wanted to say because when a language is not your mother language 
EDwsd303:342	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:343	S8:	 erm when let's say i speak english of course i put some of my native language into the english 
EDwsd303:344	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:345	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:346	S8:	 it's cou- it's could be a word and it's could be a sentence it's could be a saying and maybe to er an english speaker if i have an let's a norwegian saying 
EDwsd303:347	S1:	 hm 
EDwsd303:348	S8:	 y- e- e- i say it in english but you don't understand it because your culture your mother tongue does not have this
EDwsd303:349	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:350	S8:	 er saying so i think the lingua franca is actually when you put some of your own things into another language and it's a tool that you use 
EDwsd303:351	SX-m:	 hh 
EDwsd303:352	S8:	 with a different person 
EDwsd303:353	SX-m:	
EDwsd303:354	S8:	 who has not the same mother tongue as you but you can also erm i mean we can speak english to each other even though we speak norwegian but is that lingua franca i mean when 
EDwsd303:355	S1:	 that's a good question 
EDwsd303:356	S18:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:357	SX-m:	 hh hhh 
EDwsd303:358	S18:	 to my mind the concept of a lingua franca is as broad as to put everything in it a lingua franca to my mind and i agree completely with you is a tool for understanding it can be the mother tongue of somebody else and it can be an artificial language
EDwsd303:359	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:360	S18:	 esperanto can be a lingua franca as well 
EDwsd303:361	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:362	S18:	 and your norwegian english can be a lingua franca as well a lingua franca is the whole concept of a language which is used by linguistically diversed people to my mind but what can i add something
EDwsd303:363	S1:	 yes 
EDwsd303:364	S18:	 what i would like to add is that we have to distinguish because that came up before between a lingua franca and a language as a native language and as a foreign language these are three concepts which to my mind are different and we we should be careful not to mix them up a native language is the mother tongue
EDwsd303:365	SX-f:	 yah 
EDwsd303:366	S18:	 that would be eng- english for you for example a foreign language is the language you learn in order to talk to somebody who'd who speaks it as a native language that is me studying english and going to britain and wanting to understand their culture and wanting to talk to them and a lingua franca is the language we used or er which is used to talk to linguistically diverse people completely with different backgrounds different different languages as their mother tongues but i just want to be understood and and and understand the others
EDwsd303:367	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:368	S18:	 so i think these are three concepts which we should not mix up
EDwsd303:369	SX:	 yeah

EDwsd303:375	SS:	 yes 
EDwsd303:376	S1:	 her contribution perfect yes
EDwsd303:377	S24:	 i i agree er totally with er with she but er i i have one question the maybe we should think about it er what are we speaking about about lingua franca i i agree with that it's er 
EDwsd303:378	S1:	 hm 
EDwsd303:379	S24:	 some kind of instrument er to com- communicate with other but i am do really think that we should think about er the quality of lingua franca because i think we we should speak about about an instrument that it's a communication and that's er m- okay which language doesn't matter now but er i think the quality is already the second er 
EDwsd303:380	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd303:381	S24:	 topic or something like that because just it's or if you know what is which language is the lingua franca so after that you can speak

EDwsd303:386	S24:	 yeah 
EDwsd303:387	S1:	 to the next question does anybody agree because i heard a lot of people say erm a lingua franca is a tool to communicate with other people with a diverse linguistical group does is that something which we all have in mind with a lingua franca yeah okay perfect then we can move on does anybody object to the erm proposal that she did for the second question that we might move on to the question of erm erm sorry erm your question was about the
