EDwgd497:125	S1:	 as far that we as we can 
EDwgd497:126	S3:	 okay yeah 
EDwgd497:127	S1:	 because there is something we need the research before we do this for like the background
EDwgd497:128	S3:	 because like she said we need to know the market and the product and 
EDwgd497:129	S1:	 or something

EDwgd497:149	S3:	 yeah i know 
EDwgd497:150	S1:	 we can discuss this tomorrow

EDwgd497:155	S3:	 and then also 
EDwgd497:156	S5:	 okay 
EDwgd497:157	S3:	 you think it's good to make a decision tomorrow or at least when er when it's our document gets finished on friday

EDwgd497:159	S3:	 so what action plan will be started on 
EDwgd497:160	S4:	 cos when it's the next meeting 
EDwgd497:161	S5:	 yeah because 
EDwgd497:162	S4:	 maybe next week tuesday we can do it for 
EDwgd497:163	S3:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:164	S4:	 that would give us enough time in the weekend to do some research
EDwgd497:165	S3:	 yeah so we are going to start the with action plan next week after the when everything has been chosen when market product has been chosen 
EDwgd497:166	S5:	 er but we are going to finish start document tomorrow 
EDwgd497:167	S4:	 hh well we try and do what you can already like in during the weekend 
EDwgd497:168	S3:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:169	S3:	 okay 
EDwgd497:170	S1:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:171	S3:	 okay 
EDwgd497:172	S2:	 so this must be done for 
EDwgd497:173	S1:	 tonight 
EDwgd497:174	S2:	 tom- 
EDwgd497:175	S1:	 tomorrow 
EDwgd497:176	S5:	 is for tomorrow 
EDwgd497:177	S3:	 tomorrow 
EDwgd497:178	S1:	 or you can probably do it

EDwgd497:187	S3:	 why don't we ju- just check it tomorrow altogether 
EDwgd497:188	S4:	 i think 
EDwgd497:189	S1:	 yah 
EDwgd497:190	S3:	 when everything has been er put together we all check it 
EDwgd497:191	S4:	 yeah but if it's proofread before we've checked it always easier
EDwgd497:192	S2:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:193	S3:	 okay yeah 
EDwgd497:194	S4:	 then if i have to proofread it afterwards
EDwgd497:195	S3:	 okay yeah 
EDwgd497:196	S4:	 so if it is finished tonight i mean could you send it to me i could proofread it 
EDwgd497:197	S3:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:198	S4:	 and then we can still check it together erm make any changes 
EDwgd497:199	S3:	 okay yeah okay

EDwgd497:208	S1:	 so probably like twelve o'clock because can't x xx 
EDwgd497:209	S2:	 it will be too late for her to proofread it

EDwgd497:211	S2:	 except if you work on it now i mean you won't have to work till

EDwgd497:215	S4:	 and even if it is incomplete just send me your part so i can already read read them parts if there's only one part i still need to read at the end it's pretty easy

EDwgd497:240	S1:	 also that 
EDwgd497:241	S1:	 yah
EDwgd497:242	S5:	 @@ yeah i thought that you are going to
EDwgd497:243	S4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:244	S3:	 if he can huh because it's for some parts the market and product is necessary to know so 
EDwgd497:245	S5:	 include 
EDwgd497:246	S5:	 this it for the action plan right
EDwgd497:247	S4:	 yeah but this is er cos it's erm like critical success factors and erm organization 
EDwgd497:248	S5:	 okay then it is okay i thought this is for the 
EDwgd497:249	S3:	 mhm 
EDwgd497:250	S5:	 yes 
EDwgd497:251	S2:	 ah okay yeah 
EDwgd497:252	S4:	 process management importance yeah 
EDwgd497:253	S5:	 but you could make it even so it's like normal so 
EDwgd497:254	S3:	 okay 
EDwgd497:255	S1:	 because 
EDwgd497:256	S4:	 sometimes yeah 
EDwgd497:257	S5:	 maybe xx xx 
EDwgd497:258	S1:	 you can see it from the er handbook 
EDwgd497:259	S5:	 yeah yeah that's right 
EDwgd497:260	S4:	 and even some of the other parts even if you do legal market you can still 
EDwgd497:261	S5:	 actually i was 
EDwgd497:262	S5:	 i was a bit conf- 
EDwgd497:263	S4:	 you know 
EDwgd497:264	S5:	 actually i was bit confused i thought this is for the start document so 
EDwgd497:265	S3:	 to confirm them easily 
EDwgd497:266	S5:	 that's why i said 
EDwgd497:267	S4:	 no 
EDwgd497:268	SX-5:	 @@@
EDwgd497:269	S1:	 no the do just er see what you can do to er tuesday
EDwgd497:270	S5:	 yeah i didn't saw that 
EDwgd497:271	S5:	 yeah exactly but i i i hope i will finish them by tomorrow
EDwgd497:272	S1:	 okay 
EDwgd497:273	S5:	 yeah because i i do it later 
EDwgd497:274	S1:	
EDwgd497:275	S1:	 but don't we have group email that would be easier
EDwgd497:276	S5:	 no but 
EDwgd497:277	S3:	 do you use group emails do we use this
EDwgd497:278	S5:	 what can 
EDwgd497:279	S2:	 who wanna do that 
EDwgd497:280	S5:	 what can we do is
EDwgd497:281	S4:	 i just say send to our webmail our school email 
EDwgd497:282	S5:	 like 
EDwgd497:283	S3:	 that's what i meant yeah 
EDwgd497:284	S5:	 yes 
EDwgd497:285	S3:	 cos we also have a blackboard which is almost the same thing than a group email
EDwgd497:286	S5:	 but but 
EDwgd497:287	S5:	 no but would no what what can we do is like we can just type all of er of our er email addresses and then we can just reply and then all the times we do it like this
EDwgd497:288	S2:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:289	S5:	 you understand what i'm 
EDwgd497:290	S2:	 it go systematically to everybody 
EDwgd497:291	S5:	 then er it will be easier your private emails i mean 
EDwgd497:292	S3:	 but then when then 
EDwgd497:293	SX-4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:294	S5:	 or maybe the school webmail or something 
EDwgd497:295	S3:	 cos when er notifying somebody er about your absence saying you will not be present in a meeting then we all have to send to the leader in a message then 
EDwgd497:296	S2:	 yeah that's the part of the organization this is a goal to discuss that as well
EDwgd497:297	S3:	 that's all right 
EDwgd497:298	S1:	 yeah because it is and so something about project archive yeah and so and have to state that how did you control those documents 
EDwgd497:299	S2:	 yeah it's already 
EDwgd497:300	S1:	 so we need to decide 
EDwgd497:301	S2:	 ooph what we did last period and all the previous periods as well is for minutes and agenda every time we have meeting you try to send the agenda that twenty-four hours before the meeting
EDwgd497:302	S4:	 at least twenty-four hours 
EDwgd497:303	S2:	 at least twenty-four hours you send it to everybody and for the minutes it must be done within twenty-four hours after the meeting
EDwgd497:304	S4:	 and then just email it to everybody 
EDwgd497:305	S2:	 and email it to everybody
EDwgd497:306	S5:	 okay and 
EDwgd497:307	S2:	 and the archivist is responsible for putting the agenda in minutes every time on time 
EDwgd497:308	S5:	 yes 
EDwgd497:309	S5:	 okay 
EDwgd497:310	S2:	 on the blackboard 
EDwgd497:311	S5:	 on the blackboard yeah exactly as soon as i receive the the things i will just put them on 
EDwgd497:312	S2:	 and we keep doing it like we did last period
EDwgd497:313	S5:	 so 
EDwgd497:314	S2:	 you put a folder for agendas
EDwgd497:315	S5:	 yes 
EDwgd497:316	S5:	 okay 
EDwgd497:317	S2:	 another one for minutes 
EDwgd497:318	S5:	 okay yeah exactly 
EDwgd497:319	S1:	 okay then 
EDwgd497:320	S5:	 i mean apart from the blackboard right
EDwgd497:321	S2:	 that is for blackboard and you keep a hard copy as well
EDwgd497:322	S1:	 s- 
EDwgd497:323	S5:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:324	S5:	 yes apart from er putting them on the blackboard i keep them on i mean how do we say 
EDwgd497:325	S1:	 hh 
EDwgd497:326	S5:	 i can er keep them separately as well i mean 
EDwgd497:327	S2:	 on hard copy
EDwgd497:328	S5:	 no er not the hold copy maybe in my computer as well
EDwgd497:329	S2:	 it's up to you as long as there are on blackboard 
EDwgd497:330	S5:	 okay 
EDwgd497:331	S2:	 it's fine
EDwgd497:332	S5:	 okay yeah then it's okay maybe yeah 
EDwgd497:333	S1:	 so we communicate through our blackboard everything
EDwgd497:334	S4:	 blackboard and er web- webmail 
EDwgd497:335	S2:	 to
EDwgd497:336	S3:	 yeah webmail yeah 
EDwgd497:337	S1:	 and webmail 
EDwgd497:338	S2:	 exchange of files we can do it through blackboard if you have something to tell to somebody then you do it 
EDwgd497:339	S1:	 communicate via blackboard 
EDwgd497:340	S2:	 through emails
EDwgd497:341	S1:	 email hh and agenda before twenty-four hours before meeting and er meeting at least 
EDwgd497:342	S2:	 minutes 
EDwgd497:343	S1:	 yeah minutes after twenty-four hours
EDwgd497:344	S2:	 twenty-four hours 
EDwgd497:345	S4:	 yeah is there anything else
EDwgd497:346	S3:	 yeah about the warnings 
EDwgd497:347	SX-4:	 ooph 
EDwgd497:348	S1:	 the warning
EDwgd497:349	S4:	 i think we should do similar to what we've done before 
EDwgd497:350	S2:	 two warnings 
EDwgd497:351	S2:	 three warnings the person is out 
EDwgd497:352	S3:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:353	S4:	 no two warnings the third warning is erm 
EDwgd497:354	S2:	 the third one 
EDwgd497:355	S2:	 disqualification 
EDwgd497:356	S4:	 disqualification of the team 
EDwgd497:357	S5:	 hm mhm 
EDwgd497:358	S1:	 okay then 
EDwgd497:359	S3:	 so when you're absent or when you can can't finish a task we really just er notify er the leader or er 
EDwgd497:360	S4:	 xx x x 
EDwgd497:361	S3:	 group members er on time you know
EDwgd497:362	S5:	 yeah yeah 
EDwgd497:363	S5:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:364	S2:	 yeah i think that's must be discuss as well er 
EDwgd497:365	S1:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:366	S4:	 and i also think that plagiarism erm if you plagiarize you get two warnings straight away straight away on your your final warning
EDwgd497:367	S2:	 i think plagiarism you're out systematically 
EDwgd497:368	S3:	 okay 
EDwgd497:369	S2:	 cos it's can just disqualify the whole group and for more than a period 
EDwgd497:370	S3:	 nah i think two warnings is good not just er out 
EDwgd497:371	S1:	 no there should be some warning 
EDwgd497:372	S4:	 yeah i think if you plagiarize you're straight away you you've got one last chance
EDwgd497:373	S3:	 yeah exactly 
EDwgd497:374	S2:	 yeah we can do that 
EDwgd497:375	S1:	 so still the warning the step one warning for which reason and the second one if you do it again you're out 
EDwgd497:376	S4:	 no plagiarism erm i- whether you have already got a warning or not if you plagiarize it means that you've only one last chance so that you go straight to the second warning 
EDwgd497:377	S2:	 it can be an absence it can be anything and then you're out
EDwgd497:378	S1:	 warning 
EDwgd497:379	S1:	 so two warning we fly out 
EDwgd497:380	S4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:381	S1:	 yeah
EDwgd497:382	S4:	 yeah two warnings 
EDwgd497:383	S2:	 plagiarism it's two warnings it's not one 
EDwgd497:384	S1:	 what else 
EDwgd497:385	S1:	 the all you has one warning 
EDwgd497:386	S5:	 no plagiarism is one warning but 
EDwgd497:387	S4:	 yeah but you go straight to the second 
EDwgd497:388	S5:	 but the others we have 
EDwgd497:389	S2:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:390	S1:	 you don't have the second chance 
EDwgd497:391	S4:	 and so 
EDwgd497:392	S5:	 you already s- loose your one chance yeah 
EDwgd497:393	S1:	 you have only one chance 
EDwgd497:394	S4:	 yeah so it's not said that you've already got a warning because you was late and then you plagiarized that you get two warnings so you are out
EDwgd497:395	S2:	 and what about absences 
EDwgd497:396	S1:	 er what do we consider as one warning absent
EDwgd497:397	S4:	 someone is absent without notice
EDwgd497:398	S2:	 too late 
EDwgd497:399	S3:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:400	S4:	 someone is more than fifteen minutes late without notice
EDwgd497:401	S3:	 but without notice 
EDwgd497:402	S2:	 incomplete work 
EDwgd497:403	S4:	 incomplete work or late work
EDwgd497:404	S2:	 a bad quality work 
EDwgd497:405	S4:	 yeah incomplete that follows as well erm 
EDwgd497:406	S1:	 but the late work but er before they get late maybe they has discussion that they don't they're not able to do the task then would be acceptable 
EDwgd497:407	S4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:408	S2:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:409	S1:	 yah
EDwgd497:410	S4:	 yah
EDwgd497:411	S1:	 it depends 
EDwgd497:412	S2:	 but if you get a task and you just show up to the meeting the day after 
EDwgd497:413	S4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:414	S1:	 without discussion before 
EDwgd497:415	S2:	 with no task 
EDwgd497:416	S4:	 yeah 
EDwgd497:417	S3:	 done then you 
EDwgd497:418	S4:	 if you have a problem you should let people know that there is a problem

EDwgd497:723	S2:	 then you can you can see here how it works cos i tried to use the program it wasn't really helpful
EDwgd497:724	S1:	 yeah

EDwgd497:726	S4:	 yeah but it's on blackboard [first name2] had a- has added a link or something

EDwgd497:730	S2:	 i tried i tried to figure out i think it's better if you just do it yourself cos once you know how it works all you have to do is to add a line to the table like this and link the tasks and here it's explains how to use it and there was an example on how to use it
