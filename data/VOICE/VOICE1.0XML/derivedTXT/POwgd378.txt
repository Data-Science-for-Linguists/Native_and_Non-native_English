POwgd378:1	S3:	 translate it into their language and say 
POwgd378:2	S12:	 yes 
POwgd378:3	S3:	 er in the youth pact they are suggesting to do this and this so that this will affect you 
POwgd378:4	S12:	 that means 
POwgd378:5	S3:	 in this way
POwgd378:6	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:7	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:8	S3:	 would that help you and th- they will say yes or no and then 
POwgd378:9	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:10	S3:	 we can bring that feedback and translate it back into gibberish and then they tell the politicians and saying you know 
POwgd378:11	S12:	 actually we we are we will play a very important role of the bridge between institutions and the youth 
POwgd378:12	S3:	 yes 
POwgd378:13	S7:	 okay yeah i can understand 
POwgd378:14	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:15	S7:	 er right there's a there's a word for that in french but hh 
POwgd378:16	S3:	 yeah we are like the babel fish 
POwgd378:17	S12:	 ah yeah @@@ yeah i understand babel fish is a h electro- translation on that 
POwgd378:18	S7:	 but 
POwgd378:19	S12:	 for free

POwgd378:23	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:24	S3:	 when they couldn't communicate they put fish everywhere 
POwgd378:25	S12:	 they put a fish in the ear 
POwgd378:26	S7:	 okay 
POwgd378:27	S3:	 that's why it's called babel fish 
POwgd378:28	S12:	 you know 
POwgd378:29	S7:	 okay i missed it 
POwgd378:30	S12:	 okay so i agree with this point because we are we're here to actually tell the people what they do
POwgd378:31	S3:	 yeah or 
POwgd378:32	S12:	 in a
POwgd378:33	S3:	 erm or if we are 
POwgd378:34	S12:	 in a way that they will understand

POwgd378:36	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:37	S3:	 right er the politicians make a draft
POwgd378:38	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:39	S3:	 and this draft ins- is sent out to hearing and during this hearing process we can read the draft and we can talk to the people it actually affects and you know saying this is blah blah blah 
POwgd378:40	S12:	 yes 
POwgd378:41	S12:	 sounds xx 
POwgd378:42	S3:	 and then we can give feedback back to the politicians or the trade unions or the other organizations hh er before 
POwgd378:43	S12:	 mhm

POwgd378:64	S12:	 you should we touch at least the 
POwgd378:65	S3:	 er 
POwgd378:66	S12:	 the thing that actually or that's that we have to be also informed on time 
POwgd378:67	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:68	S12:	 and 
POwgd378:69	S3:	 but i i 
POwgd378:70	S12:	 about er everything er what is happening or we are just discussing the youth pact the situation

POwgd378:73	S3:	 hm hh yeah i i think erm yeah erm 
POwgd378:74	S12:	 how much we are generalizing the story that's the thing
POwgd378:75	S3:	 hh yeah b- b- erm you mean that we should be given you know whenever such documents are made that we should be given the drafts or
POwgd378:76	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:77	S3:	 what 
POwgd378:78	S12:	 well you can't ask the institutions to to to give you because there's too many n g os and youth organizations but 
POwgd378:79	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:80	S12:	 er to have our channels to reach the inform- the all important informations or draft papers or 
POwgd378:81	S3:	 and i mean er some other problem is that all the information is there it's just to find the right website and download the draft but but xx xx 
POwgd378:82	S12:	 well 
POwgd378:83	S12:	 sometimes that's just is not just just @@
POwgd378:84	S3:	 well i mean it is just if if you're used to the system but i mean 
POwgd378:85	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:86	S3:	 let's face it normal youth organizations we are not supposed to spend our time searching the internet for blah blah blah we're supposed to spend our time interacting with youth so i think 
POwgd378:87	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:88	S3:	 a part of this what we are asking the way i feel is to be automatically included so that we do not go to the politicians and ask can we have this draft 
POwgd378:89	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:90	S3:	 but that their administration at the governments 
POwgd378:91	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:92	S3:	 automatically sends it out to us 
POwgd378:93	S12:	 yeah that's it 
POwgd378:94	S3:	 i- if that's you know something you could ask for because that that doesn't cost anything it's just 
POwgd378:95	S12:	 well yeah 
POwgd378:96	S7:	 yeah i do agree with you 
POwgd378:97	S3:	 just add one more email address you know
POwgd378:98	S12:	 mhm yeah but before that er youth organization has to be subscribed somewhere s- to to announce that they really want to receive such an an information 
POwgd378:99	S3:	 yeah but i mean erm they could make a system for that 
POwgd378:100	S12:	 okay let's say that it already exist or 
POwgd378:101	S3:	 because erm 
POwgd378:102	S12:	 or we should er er ask for it
POwgd378:103	S3:	 er 
POwgd378:104	S3:	 er for example er there could i mean it's it's not very difficult if if when you log in to your government's website 
POwgd378:105	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:106	S3:	 er there could just be you know write the email address of your organization

POwgd378:113	S3:	 and 
POwgd378:114	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:115	S3:	 and then er of course the administration has to use their brains and not send us all sorts of crap but you know the thing that affects youth and
POwgd378:116	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:117	S3:	 that would be one way should i put that one down or
POwgd378:118	S12:	 yes i think yes

POwgd378:120	S12:	 the way of reaching informations

POwgd378:135	S1:	 so if i'm a government or whatever and i decide er okay i will issue a law on youth employment who should i call 
POwgd378:136	S3:	 hm or er not necessarily call but erm 
POwgd378:137	S12:	 i think we have additional channels to 
POwgd378:138	S3:	 that er for example you issue a law on youth er employment before the law is issued er a draft is made and it's sent out to hearing right
POwgd378:139	S1:	 mhm

POwgd378:152	S3:	 okay well er that er

POwgd378:156	S1:	 precise 
POwgd378:157	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:158	S1:	 and i thought that before xx that's true 
POwgd378:159	S3:	 hm 
POwgd378:160	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd378:161	S3:	 but the problem with this is that it's i mean it's very hard to to see when does it affect youth and when does it not because er i mean er there are so many laws passed that e- almost everyone affect youth in a way way or another and er if er every youth organization would receive everything then you would just start s- you you would just stop reading right and just throw it in the trash can but yeah hm 
POwgd378:162	S12:	 so that will be more organization the network 
POwgd378:163	S3:	 so i write here that we should be a part of the process so that we don't just get the result but that we are a part of the process
POwgd378:164	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:165	S3:	 and o- one way this could be channelled i mean we all have a erm in our erm i mean there are a lot of national youth councils there yeah but er also the organizations that works with the disadvantaged er youth they had like an umbrella organization and they could receive you know
POwgd378:166	S12:	 yeah that's enough and then they spreading 
POwgd378:167	S3:	 and and and then they could 
POwgd378:168	S3:	 then 
POwgd378:169	S12:	 the 
POwgd378:170	S3:	 oh this is something this organization could help with and we send it to them and you know 
POwgd378:171	S12:	 info 
POwgd378:172	S12:	 a cooperation between different organizations you want to say
POwgd378:173	S3:	 no i mean erm erm let's say er erm erm let's say you are a organization for example erm a xx movement or whatever it's called you know okay er you're an you're an organization in your town
POwgd378:174	S12:	 n- no 
POwgd378:175	S3:	 you are working with disadvantaged youth right
POwgd378:176	S12:	 let's say mhm
POwgd378:177	S3:	 yeah er i mean you are a small organization in this little town all right but you have above you an umbrella organization 
POwgd378:178	S12:	 yeah okay 
POwgd378:179	S3:	 a lot of times right
POwgd378:180	S3:	 that er that er gathers all the small 
POwgd378:181	S12:	 small 
POwgd378:182	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd378:183	S12:	 organizations 
POwgd378:184	S3:	 but works with er disadvantaged youth 
POwgd378:185	S12:	 dealing the s- the same topic 
POwgd378:186	S3:	 yeah and this organization is very often a part of a larger one which has all organizations that deals with children and young people
POwgd378:187	S12:	 hm
POwgd378:188	S3:	 or at least that's how it works in er 
POwgd378:189	S12:	 in norway
POwgd378:190	S3:	 norway it's you know a lot of 
POwgd378:191	S12:	 okay i understand the system you're trying to explain so in that case that the largest organization dealing with children in general is receiving the info and then they are spreading to the organizations for disability xx for the organizations for blah blah blah
POwgd378:192	S3:	 hm 
POwgd378:193	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd378:194	S12:	 so it's like top bottom 
POwgd378:195	S3:	 for example 
POwgd378:196	S12:	 approach 
POwgd378:197	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd378:198	S12:	 okay 
POwgd378:199	S3:	 and of course if you want to you can have a bottom top approach i mean if you in your little town decide 
POwgd378:200	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:201	S3:	 okay i wanna receive all the information then you can just you know log onto a website for example and yeah 
POwgd378:202	S12:	 yeah
POwgd378:203	S7:	 mhm 
POwgd378:204	S12:	 yeah in that in that way it it asks a little bit more involvement of the erm erm persons but erm when we are talking about erm connections between erm institutions or decision makers and the organizations in general
POwgd378:205	S3:	 hm 
POwgd378:206	S12:	 i think that the top bottom approach is better
POwgd378:207	S3:	 yeah mhm
POwgd378:208	S12:	 mhm but then we have also inside the network inside the organization we're also u- using that approach er so the the main body the core team is receiving the info and they're giving it to the spreading through the through the network 
POwgd378:209	S3:	 but but i think erm erm i mean that the people are working with drafting if it's a law or a policy
POwgd378:210	S12:	 mhm
POwgd378:211	S3:	 i mean they er they should be able to think who will this law affect
POwgd378:212	S12:	 yeah 
POwgd378:213	S3:	 i mean they should be that smart and be able to do that er i know they are politicians but you know perhaps they are able to do it and 
POwgd378:214	S12:	 @@
POwgd378:215	S3:	 erm and that er you know that could be a erm n- not necessarily a demand but something we say that you should think about this
POwgd378:216	S12:	 mhm yeah of course 
POwgd378:217	S3:	 and 
POwgd378:218	S3:	 and that er yeah but i erm i mean a a larger organization who has enough money to employ people full time to do lobbying doesn't have this problem but @@ i mean er people who work with disadvantaged youth that's not their job so it's about you know the administration in the government making it easier to participate in a way 
POwgd378:219	S12:	 mhm mhm you have something to add
POwgd378:220	S7:	 not at the moment for me it's right
POwgd378:221	S12:	 yeah it's it's great 
POwgd378:222	S3:	 and but or do you have any other arguments why we should be a part of the process er other than that we are a bridge between the people that laws are affecting and the politicians 
POwgd378:223	S12:	 yeah exactly 
POwgd378:224	S7:	 yeah to to 
POwgd378:225	S7:	 er to state that's all intern it's because you you can be a bridge between the authorities and the and the youth 
POwgd378:226	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:227	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:228	S7:	 you must be a part of the process 
POwgd378:229	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd378:230	S12:	 yeah that's true and why because it's directly affecting us as a youth of the country or well you know 
POwgd378:231	S3:	 yeah erm 
POwgd378:232	S12:	 it's kind of a nonsense that we have these decis- decision makers they make a decision @
POwgd378:233	S7:	 without 
POwgd378:234	S12:	 and that's it 
POwgd378:235	S7:	 yeah 
POwgd378:236	S12:	 without the feedback the feedback is very important because affecting us 
POwgd378:237	S3:	 the decision makers should always consult the people their @ decisions are affecting 
POwgd378:238	S12:	 y- yeah or just make it short that er the feedback is er hh how to say 
POwgd378:239	S7:	 at least consult the organizations 
POwgd378:240	S3:	 that it must be in a process 
POwgd378:241	S7:	 mhm 
POwgd378:242	S12:	 that means the obligatory that's it 
POwgd378:243	S3:	 yeah and i mean they do this in almost all other areas when they are making a policy or a law i mean 
POwgd378:244	S12:	 yes 
POwgd378:245	S3:	 if you are making a law you make sure that erm you know that people who work with lawyers and law firms and you know 
POwgd378:246	S12:	 mhm 
POwgd378:247	S3:	 their organizations are always consulted and academia is consulted and if you if you er make a law about i don't know whatever transport i mean you consult 
POwgd378:248	S12:	 the logistical 
POwgd378:249	S3:	 the m- 
POwgd378:250	S3:	 yeah the companies that work with it and it should be the same about the people 
POwgd378:251	S12:	 yeah of course especially the youth because 
POwgd378:252	S3:	 mhm 
POwgd378:253	S12:	 i mean t- the future of the country i mean @@ the future decision makers or 
POwgd378:254	S3:	 hm 
POwgd378:255	S12:	 cos m- i mean when we say youth we are thinking also of in on the really young young people who are maybe not always able to er make a decision but for sure their voice is precious because we want to hear them to how they are thinking and erm their and their opinions of the current situation i mean yeah the feedback is not always erm how to say hm
POwgd378:256	S8:	 okay let's get back in the whole group just stop where you are right now and then present what you have so far 
POwgd378:257	S3:	 okay what if i say that they should keep in mind that youth organizations a lot of youth most youth organizations are not political
POwgd378:258	S12:	 mhm
POwgd378:259	S3:	 and erm and their job is not to be lobbyists all the time and that the administration should make should strive to make it easier for them to participate because they have to remember that they aren't politicians sort of if you understand what i mean 
POwgd378:260	S12:	 okay xxx @
POwgd378:261	S3:	 yeah 
POwgd378:262	S12:	 yeah i understand but that's er only a theoretical story i think that organization can't exist or successfully work without lobbying
POwgd378:263	S3:	 well 
POwgd378:264	S8:	 okay can we invite the public authorities as well to come back 
POwgd378:265	S3:	 yeah i know but it has to be 
POwgd378:266	S3:	 easier 
POwgd378:267	S3:	 to lobby 
POwgd378:268	S12:	 aha okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
