PBmtg462:235	S6:	 no
PBmtg462:236	S3:	 no no 
PBmtg462:237	S6:	 cos he is the international boss

PBmtg462:239	S3:	 erm [org2] 
PBmtg462:240	S1:	 [org2] and in bo- bosnia they they are much better i think 
PBmtg462:241	S3:	 yes 
PBmtg462:242	S1:	 but in serbia they were very bad because they didn't have an organization to support small shops and also they just released it in big shops and nothing else
PBmtg462:243	S3:	 and 
PBmtg462:244	S3:	 and then we have [org3] 
PBmtg462:245	S1:	 so
PBmtg462:246	S3:	 from germany which probably you don't know these are chewing gums
PBmtg462:247	S1:	 licensed

PBmtg462:251	S1:	 and mickey mouse 
PBmtg462:252	S3:	 and mickey mouse but unfortunately they're not barcoded a un- per per unit so it's only for the erm for the grey channel in fact we can only sell it to the small shops
PBmtg462:253	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:254	S5:	 and do you do [thing2] 
PBmtg462:255	S3:	 no we put it in the report but not with a no we put it 
PBmtg462:256	S5:	 okay because i'm yah yah okay 
PBmtg462:257	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg462:258	S3:	 we put it because hh it's in the contract 
PBmtg462:259	S5:	 okay

PBmtg462:270	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg462:271	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg462:272	S1:	 but er they have no licence for serbia so we cannot do it any more
PBmtg462:273	S3:	 so 
PBmtg462:274	S3:	 we practically stopped
PBmtg462:275	S5:	 uhu 
PBmtg462:276	S5:	 uhu 
PBmtg462:277	S1:	 because we have doing it erm unlegally through spain 
PBmtg462:278	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg462:279	S5:	 okay yeah yeah 
PBmtg462:280	S1:	 and now it became er dangerous so we stopped
PBmtg462:281	S5:	 okay okay and [thing3] was more like 
PBmtg462:282	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:283	S3:	 [thing3]'s we we're we we er we still do it
PBmtg462:284	S5:	 failure 
PBmtg462:285	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg462:286	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:287	S3:	 but it 
PBmtg462:288	S5:	 on a low level

PBmtg462:290	S5:	 okay 
PBmtg462:291	S1:	 it's not so strong 
PBmtg462:292	S3:	 it's not that you have er do you still th- have the plans regarding [S6] 
PBmtg462:293	S5:	 hh no
PBmtg462:294	S3:	 regarding the erm 
PBmtg462:295	S5:	 regarding regarding [thing3] k- kind of cooperation not really it's
PBmtg462:296	S3:	 no 
PBmtg462:297	S3:	 no y- y- y- you were thinking last time you were saying you're you're you are going to buy them but 
PBmtg462:298	S5:	 right right right right right right yeah 
PBmtg462:299	S6:	 the the problem is i can tell you the problem is erm it was n- not a clear target of both of us because 
PBmtg462:300	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:301	S6:	 er we were ready to to also to invest in the brand because they wanted to have a serious market entry or marked launch in in the u s
PBmtg462:302	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:303	S6:	 and er we said okay we can imagine that to build up a brand there but only if we have any kind of company linking whatever you can can do and they said no first of all we should show them 
PBmtg462:304	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:305	S6:	 what we could do and then @@ they will talk about this and then we say okay it's no brand so we don't build up a brand which is not ours 
PBmtg462:306	S3:	 in serbia if it if it would be [org5] licence [org5]-branded product it could make a a a rather big impact yeah 
PBmtg462:307	S6:	 it was you know it was in our fantasy no- not just to to to to name the packaging [org5] but to make 
PBmtg462:308	S1:	 xxxx it's more expensive 
PBmtg462:309	S5:	 mhm a combination yah yah 
PBmtg462:310	S6:	 a [org5] content out of that and er 
PBmtg462:311	S3:	 just go and produce them
PBmtg462:312	S6:	 this was you know what we have in mind to to also develop that things 
PBmtg462:313	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:314	S6:	 but finally they they say they want n- not in the first step they wanna have any kind of of er relation between the companies 
PBmtg462:315	S3:	 just j- j- just as the same product with [org5] 
PBmtg462:316	S5:	 it would be much easier you think
PBmtg462:317	S3:	 it would be it would be better sales much better sales hh but if you if you could keep the same price not not giving it 
PBmtg462:318	S5:	 it could it could it could even work mhm 
PBmtg462:319	S3:	 as a licence product but just put [ORG5] brand on it 
PBmtg462:320	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg462:321	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:322	S3:	 for us yeah i don't know about 
PBmtg462:323	S5:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:324	S1:	 but t- the but the price wouldn't be the same x xx 
PBmtg462:325	S3:	 yeah if they keep i said if they keep the same price not licensed product just 
PBmtg462:326	S1:	 no 
PBmtg462:327	S3:	 put [org5] on it 
PBmtg462:328	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:329	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:330	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:331	S1:	 but even they they had something tom and jerry but it wasn't 
PBmtg462:332	S3:	 didn't work because it was too expensive it was licensed and then it was more expensive didn't work 
PBmtg462:333	S1:	 no 
PBmtg462:334	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:335	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:336	S5:	 sure because 
PBmtg462:337	S6:	 yeah yeah 
PBmtg462:338	S1:	 and tom and jerry is not er so popular any more 
PBmtg462:339	S6:	 so at this stage the the talks to them

PBmtg462:682	S3:	 well 
PBmtg462:683	S3:	 the idea came because of of [org13] but in fact we made more of them and we replace where 
PBmtg462:684	S1:	 er you were also complaining when you were there that if we put it the er checkout shelf it was not er 
PBmtg462:685	SX-f:	 xx x xx 
PBmtg462:686	S1:	 good visual so we decided to make this little 
PBmtg462:687	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:688	S1:	 er and in [org13] they er allowed us to do so so we'll try to do it obviously in other 
PBmtg462:689	S4:	 hm wow 
PBmtg462:690	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:691	S1:	 er outlets of [org14] and and [org15]

PBmtg462:693	S1:	 yes
PBmtg462:694	S5:	 it's for mhm mhm six hooks mhm 
PBmtg462:695	S1:	 and the idea is that if they can see in [org13] that the turnover is better if we place it like this they will 
PBmtg462:696	S6:	 mhm
PBmtg462:697	S1:	 er maybe allow us to do it er in other outlets of their

PBmtg462:840	S5:	 yah yah yah
PBmtg462:841	S1:	 when we do something like this yes 
PBmtg462:842	S5:	 cos yeah yeah yah yah 
PBmtg462:843	S7:	 xxx xxx 
PBmtg462:844	S3:	 okay 
PBmtg462:845	S1:	 this is why we er er decided er with your help to do it er with [org19] it was in fact [first name2]'s er er [S6]'s idea because you did it here with er [org20] or something 
PBmtg462:846	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:847	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:848	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:849	S1:	 but [org19] er is the the 
PBmtg462:850	S5:	 the big 
PBmtg462:851	S1:	 the only and the biggest er respective
PBmtg462:852	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:853	S1:	 organization that people trust 
PBmtg462:854	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:855	S1:	 and of course they have their own er possibilities which we can use
PBmtg462:856	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:857	S1:	 to to have er attention of the public and it's always cheaper when we do it with [org19] than we when we do it ourselves and that's why it's maybe a good idea but we will have the results 
PBmtg462:858	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg462:859	S1:	 in six months at the moment this is er too early to say if it really helps turnover 
PBmtg462:860	SS:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:861	S1:	 but anyway er er considering the image 
PBmtg462:862	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:863	S6:	 any other image it's
PBmtg462:864	S4:	 it's good yeah 
PBmtg462:865	S1:	 it's it's it's very good 
PBmtg462:866	S6:	 gets a support 
PBmtg462:867	S4:	 and you did it for [org5] and [org12] 
PBmtg462:868	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:869	S1:	 yes because then it's easier for us because we er give them one per cent of complete turnover yearly turnover of [org12] and [org5] which is of course not too much but it helps
PBmtg462:870	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg462:871	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:872	S1:	 so er we er support the action of [org19] called er schools without violence which is er a problem in serbia hh because several kids were killed during last year in the schools 
PBmtg462:873	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:874	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:875	S1:	 but not only er that kind of violence but also verbal dia- d- er hh er violence and anything else unpleasant which can be done to children in the schools even hh 
PBmtg462:876	S5:	 hm mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:877	S1:	 er from from teachers themselves and so
PBmtg462:878	S4:	 hm 
PBmtg462:879	S1:	 so the action is very er popular in serbia at the moment and 
PBmtg462:880	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:881	S1:	 with the money of [org5] and [org12] they can adapt er schools were they in fact try to do actions so every month we adapt another school and the media show it on t v 
PBmtg462:882	S6:	 mhm
PBmtg462:883	S5:	 okay okay 
PBmtg462:884	S1:	 and then we have a big certificate of [org5] and [org12] and [org19] in the school so the children can see it every day hh and we can do also actions around and then we are allowed to put our posters about [org19] everywhere announcing that children can help to children buying [org5] and [org12] and this is idea that children can help children
PBmtg462:885	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:886	S5:	 mhm mhm by buying the products
PBmtg462:887	S1:	 by er 
PBmtg462:888	S1:	 by buy- by buying and because one per cent part of it 
PBmtg462:889	SX:	
PBmtg462:890	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:891	S1:	 goes for the action
PBmtg462:892	S5:	 goes for charity mhm 
PBmtg462:893	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:894	S6:	 very nice idea
PBmtg462:895	S5:	 hh and do you do the stickering
PBmtg462:896	S1:	 and er i have to say that it was yes and it was very difficult to get it because the permission doesn't give [org19] er belgrade
PBmtg462:897	S5:	 xx xx x x 
PBmtg462:898	S1:	 and serbia but [org19] geneva
PBmtg462:899	S4:	 ah with the rulers 
PBmtg462:900	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:901	S3:	 and the stickers 
PBmtg462:902	S5:	 okay
PBmtg462:903	S3:	 we do the stickering 
PBmtg462:904	S1:	 th- this was the action with the ruler but er you will see later on that all the 
PBmtg462:905	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:906	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:907	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:908	S1:	 products have sticker hhh and so geneva had to approve it 
PBmtg462:909	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg462:910	S1:	 and it was very difficult because for example they rejected [org21] and many other factories if they have some reasons apology or anything else w- er what they can find 
PBmtg462:911	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:912	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:913	S1:	 against
PBmtg462:914	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:915	S1:	 so er i- i- it took us more than four five months in negotiations with [org19] serbia to have approval from [org19] geneva and at last we got it
PBmtg462:916	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:917	S1:	 and this is first time they gave such a thing
PBmtg462:918	S5:	 mhm mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:919	S1:	 so maybe you can do it in some other countries easier now
PBmtg462:920	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:921	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:922	S1:	 if you find it attractive
PBmtg462:923	S4:	 it's very attractive actually 
PBmtg462:924	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:925	S5:	 it was the first time to give it er to such kind of products which means confectionery or the first time in general in in in belgrade 
PBmtg462:926	S1:	 in serbia in general but if i could understand also er they are very strict with er with confectionery because they consider it er not so healthy because of sugar and everything else but because this is a children program
PBmtg462:927	S5:	 right okay yeah yeah yeah 
PBmtg462:928	S1:	 hh and because it has this nice licences which doesn't have anything to do with any kind of violence 
PBmtg462:929	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:930	S5:	 right mhm 
PBmtg462:931	S1:	 and because it has this idea that children can help children this is something that they liked
PBmtg462:932	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:933	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:934	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:935	S6:	 it's really good idea
PBmtg462:936	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:937	S6:	 this was developed with the local [org19] people or 
PBmtg462:938	S1:	 it was er our idea then we wrote them and er we negotiated with them and then they wrote er our letter and our presentation and what we do for [org5] 
PBmtg462:939	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:940	S1:	 er for many years in serbia and so on and for course we said that er which is true hh [org5] is bigger brand than [org19] in serbia people more know about [org5] than about [org19] that [org5] can help even 
PBmtg462:941	S5:	 hm yah yeah yeah 
PBmtg462:942	S1:	 their approach and the approach of their ideas 
PBmtg462:943	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:944	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:945	S4:	 to create an image as well 
PBmtg462:946	S1:	 and er w- we persuaded them that it could help also the whole idea and in serbia [org19] is doing very er big job because er this a country where we really need that kind of charity and help 
PBmtg462:947	S5:	 yah yah yah yah yah 
PBmtg462:948	S1:	 so they agreed
PBmtg462:949	S5:	 hm 
PBmtg462:950	S6:	 mhm wow
PBmtg462:951	SX-3:	 i've actually brought this with a free x xx x xx xxx 
PBmtg462:952	S5:	 so-called win-win 
PBmtg462:953	S1:	 and of course er w- when products are er marked by this maybe this is not t- t- the best way but it was the quickest we could do 
PBmtg462:954	S5:	 mhm
PBmtg462:955	S1:	 hh although they wanted something to be here but it was er it was er too complicated to start quickly with 
PBmtg462:956	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:957	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:958	S1:	 hh so we did it for the beginning like this and they said we will have trial period of six months to see if it give er results to us as well
PBmtg462:959	SX-f:	
PBmtg462:960	S1:	 hh erm it is easier to to come to any shop with products which have this because stores like to have it and then they er 
PBmtg462:961	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:962	S4:	 mhm hm it's for the image as well for the store 
PBmtg462:963	S1:	 for the image of the store and then of course they offer it to people 
PBmtg462:964	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:965	S1:	 so i'm so we will see what will happen 
PBmtg462:966	S6:	 very good
PBmtg462:967	S5:	 and you started one month ago or 
PBmtg462:968	S1:	 one month ago or something like this yeah so our people went to any shop er to put to the previous stock 
PBmtg462:969	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:970	S4:	 aha the 
PBmtg462:971	S5:	 aha okay 
PBmtg462:972	S1:	 as well er the the stickers and er now in now er warehouse every item is sticked er in 
PBmtg462:973	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:974	S1:	 in in in the i- before it it goes 
PBmtg462:975	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:976	S4:	 goes out 
PBmtg462:977	S1:	 out yeah so the newest t v campaign that we have is on the nation- 
PBmtg462:978	S6:	 but it's a very innovate idea in total i mean because you know violence in the schools is not only a topic in 
PBmtg462:979	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:980	S6:	 in serbia nowadays
PBmtg462:981	SX-f:	
PBmtg462:982	SS:	 yes 
PBmtg462:983	S1:	 yes yeah 
PBmtg462:984	S6:	 it's er also more and more even in austria
PBmtg462:985	S1:	 yes 
PBmtg462:986	S6:	 and er that that kids can help kids
PBmtg462:987	S1:	 this this was the idea
PBmtg462:988	S6:	 it's nice 
PBmtg462:989	S1:	 kids to kids this is the the the main slogan 
PBmtg462:990	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:991	S6:	 because you know in in in the we have in in in austria or germany we have the campaign that you should not look away you know the slogan is don't look away so if see something bring it up and 
PBmtg462:992	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:993	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:994	S6:	 and try to help xx 
PBmtg462:995	S1:	 like it happened to my son two days ago he was attacked in greece by some er albanians with a knife hh and they stole his pho- ph- er mobile phone which is not important thing i mean the mobile phone but the fear that er

PBmtg462:1034	S5:	 mhm mhm 
PBmtg462:1035	S1:	 even by a small thing like one per cent of of

PBmtg462:2282	S3:	 w- working for example two new variants of [org9] last year and we are still not listed with those two because they are they're in serbia they're operate like that they're very slow and they change the twice the manager

PBmtg462:2289	S3:	 what interests [S6] the most @@@@@@@@@@@@
PBmtg462:2290	S4:	 the plan for next year 
PBmtg462:2291	S6:	 this is all 
PBmtg462:2292	S1:	 but we have 
PBmtg462:2293	S3:	 this is all what interes- 
PBmtg462:2294	S6:	 interest me most 
PBmtg462:2295	S3:	 @@@@
PBmtg462:2296	S6:	 up to now
PBmtg462:2297	S1:	 we have now division by customers it is er more important for you [S4] because you know them
PBmtg462:2298	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2299	S1:	 then sales by territories which is be- belgrade as usual the strongest specially in er dispensers 
PBmtg462:2300	S3:	 dispenser 
PBmtg462:2301	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2302	S1:	 xx xx x xx 
PBmtg462:2303	S3:	 no 
PBmtg462:2304	SX-7:	 xxx xx 
PBmtg462:2305	S5:	 hm er may i have a question i i don't understand this hh er for example [org10] you have got three [org10]s
PBmtg462:2306	S3:	 yes 
PBmtg462:2307	S3:	 yes in serbia 
PBmtg462:2308	S5:	 okay hh and what what do you mean by twelve twelve these are the checkouts or 
PBmtg462:2309	S3:	 checkouts
PBmtg462:2310	S5:	 okay the number of checkouts
PBmtg462:2311	S3:	 yes
PBmtg462:2312	S1:	 number of checkouts 
PBmtg462:2313	S5:	 okay thank you 
PBmtg462:2314	S6:	 but what's surprising me in the south serbia we have ten per cent of dispenser sales but only five per cent in 
PBmtg462:2315	S4:	 and the basement dann sind zwoelf boxen 
PBmtg462:2316	S4:	 [thing1] 
PBmtg462:2317	S4:	 also beide sind sind gelisted 
PBmtg462:2318	S5:	 sind im checkout ja ja ja ja 
PBmtg462:2319	S6:	 in refill sales
PBmtg462:2320	S5:	 ja ja
PBmtg462:2321	S3:	 in the south serbia 
PBmtg462:2322	S6:	 yeah
PBmtg462:2323	S3:	
PBmtg462:2324	S6:	 i expected it the other way around
PBmtg462:2325	S1:	 no because er er in south serbia it comes from the black market
PBmtg462:2326	S3:	 hm from kosovo 
PBmtg462:2327	S1:	 from kosovo and in kosovo it comes i don't know where from because er [org8] is also not er purchasing er refills as you know but o- only o- dis- dis- 
PBmtg462:2328	S7:	 just figures 
PBmtg462:2329	S1:	 just dispensers
PBmtg462:2330	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2331	S7:	 dispensers 
PBmtg462:2332	S1:	 because er black market there is very strong
PBmtg462:2333	S3:	 and bracelets when he can have them
PBmtg462:2334	S6:	 mhm
PBmtg462:2335	S1:	 so er 
PBmtg462:2336	S7:	 x x xx xx x 
PBmtg462:2337	S1:	 the the the 
PBmtg462:2338	S5:	 on the black market
PBmtg462:2339	SS:	 no 
PBmtg462:2340	S3:	 he's purchasing bracelets when he can have them 
PBmtg462:2341	S1:	 and dispensers and he doesn't order 
PBmtg462:2342	S5:	 okay
PBmtg462:2343	S7:	 xx xx 
PBmtg462:2344	S1:	 refills at all and this the same in south serbia er the the refills come from somewhere for a very cheap price so that's why we cannot sell it there very well
PBmtg462:2345	S3:	 yeah
PBmtg462:2346	S1:	 it was always like you said it is it was always that in south serbia in in the years before in the past we had much better sales of refills but not at the moment and this is the impact of 
PBmtg462:2347	S6:	 mhm aber einen haben wir gefunden oder 
PBmtg462:2348	S1:	 black market 
PBmtg462:2349	S1:	 south serbia er this is a part near the kosovo border and this is the problem of hh 
PBmtg462:2350	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2351	S1:	 kosovo black black mailing i- no- not black mailing but er 
PBmtg462:2352	S3:	 or from bosnia 
PBmtg462:2353	S3:	 black marketing
PBmtg462:2354	S1:	 black black black marketing
PBmtg462:2355	S3:	 but 
PBmtg462:2356	S3:	 it could be that also comes from bosnia there is the part of serbia called [place5] it's between bosnia and kosovo and serbia 
PBmtg462:2357	S6:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2358	S1:	 so they smuggle it somehow without paying all the taxes and er it's very cheap so 
PBmtg462:2359	S6:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:2360	S6:	 one way we found one way of smuggling
PBmtg462:2361	S3:	 what 
PBmtg462:2362	S6:	 and we will stop it
PBmtg462:2363	S3:	 really okay 
PBmtg462:2364	S1:	 we have er we have noticed that t- this is er decreasing i- in belgrade
PBmtg462:2365	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2366	S5:	 mhm 
PBmtg462:2367	S6:	 yeah 
PBmtg462:2368	S4:	 it should

PBmtg462:2396	S3:	 hhh so ba- basically the er er the the central is the cen- the th- if you if you look it by territories the sixty per cent sa- the sixty-seven per cent share of sales is due to the fact the simple fact that half of the population lives
