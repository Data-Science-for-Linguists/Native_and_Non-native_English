1. Contents
-----------

This directory contains prepared hypertext (HTML) files derived from
the XML version of the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English
(VOICE). The files correspond to the edition of VOICE XML indicated by
the name of the parent folder (i.e. VOICE1.0XML or VOICE1.1XML). This
derived HTML version of VOICE is provided only for users'
convenience. It is similar to the output format 'voice style' provided
in the VOICE Online interface (http://voice.univie.ac.at). Please note
that the XML version of VOICE (and hence the corpus files provided in
the folder XML) is to be considered the main point of reference, since
it comprises all annotation layers available in VOICE.
