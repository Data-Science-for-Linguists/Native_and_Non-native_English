POmtg546:40	S3:	 erm even though the two networks being children of different parents erm they personalize national legal frameworks for recognition and each number er each member of the network hh occupied with the same issues and sharing practically the same mandate and tasks erm they are basically engaged which you all know in the areas of recognition of academic and ever more so in professional recognition issues providing and distributing information on educational systems and recognition practices to domestic and foreign uses and then encouraging mobility in the higher education area by helping developing and implementing transparency tools hh respectively diploma supplement and e c t s hh through their close cooperation and common goals the two networks have developed effective mechanisms of communication hh and established forms of sharing practices information and constructing common views and strategies towards the challenges in the development of education systems and the practices for recognizing the issues and the outcomes hh the forms which are most commonly used and have proved very effective are the [org1] [org2] common site which er represents sort of a wide view of information for the widest range of er uses which represents the educational systems and the systems of recognition

POmtg546:55	S3:	 then there are working parties hh which represent a very substantial erm view of communicating coping with new challenges and developing strategies annual meetings which are done by the two networks together this year seventh and the eighth of june in [place1] then there is cooperation with other networks which is contributing to the common goal which are defining which we are defining also on this meeting and there are erm various study visits very much like the cooperation that [S1] mentioned before on the nordic countries which which goes on between the member countries of the two networks and the concrete study visits of the staff hh er the two networks played an important role in preparing the [org4] and council of europe code of good practice in the provision of transnational education which clearly points to the to the direction that the er networks are very closely connected to the new phenomena in the higher education hh the recommendational criteria and procedures for the assessment of foreign qualifications both of which were adopted by the [name1] recognition convention committee in two thousand and one at their two thousand and three meeting the network considered a draft recommendation on the recognition of joint degrees to be submitted to the convention committee for adoption in two thousand and four so the burning issues being the transnational education the joint degrees erm and the er criteria hh and procedures for the recognition hh it was also last year that the continuation to contribute to the bologna process and full support to the ultimate goal of the european higher education area was decidedly confirmed at [place2] annual meeting of the networks this decision was put into the [place2] statement the document put on the [place4] table thus committing the networks as well as committing the national centers er to their mission er to contribute to the same goal by particularly seeking to facilitate recognition of qualifications to developing cooperations between the recognition and quality assurance by improving information on the recognition of foreign qualifications by improving recognition of joint degrees developing procedures aiming at recognition of learning outcomes hh by contributing to the development of transparent qualification frameworks by improving recognition of qualifications from other parts of the world hh underlining the need for international cooperation to be based on clear and transparent quality standards and developing model terms of reference for the national individual national information centers these goals are ambitious and er will if not already done so hh no doubt evoke some self-evaluation of the national centers erm however on the other hand these goals encourage further and wider cooperation between the actors of creating the european higher education area and while recognition represents the cornerstone of a m- mobility the quality in education represents the cornerstone hh of recognition which has been put on the table today for quite a number of times so the strategies in the future er xx x er will be further on presented by by you
POmtg546:56	S5:	 hh 
POmtg546:57	S3:	 right
POmtg546:58	S5:	 well in our division of labor i was more or less focusing on the issue which we would like to discuss here that's the quality issue 
POmtg546:59	S3:	 that's right 
POmtg546:60	S3:	 yes 
POmtg546:61	S5:	 i think that's most er relevant er for this er for this meeting hh and erm er more concretely this also has been the the major hh issue in the cooperation between [org3] er and the er [org1] [org2] network hh networks must say hh erm in a joint working group because in a way i think that hh you will find the er the perspective of recognition international recognition of degrees hh on er quality assurance er in our erm document er annexe nine [place1] statement on the recognition issues in the european higher education area you don't have to read it now but in er in the paragraphs seven hh and eight hh it's sort of er er th- the core of our ideas in a nutshell because the er the issue or the question about the quality is er as we said before the the first first er question hh that an admissions officer or a xxxxxx or recognition someone poses erm er handling a foreign qualification so in a way er er international recognition heavily depends on quality assurance systems on information on quality assurance systems and erm in a way on the fact that an educational provider has been erm er subjected hh to some so- some form of quality assessment accreditation et cetera because if we can't answer that question we really have a problem and then also of course you can still answer the the the or or or tackle the other issues x structure content credits et cetera but if you don't have the 
POmtg546:62	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:63	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:64	S5:	 answer to the quality question you still have a problem and that's something which we which we realize and it's also an issue that is really becoming erm er crucial to us so erm again and that's the the the th- th- th- the means that we have is to er go to the quality assurance people er quality assurance world and try to discuss things 
POmtg546:65	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:66	S5:	 hh what kind of themes are erm common what kind of questions do we have to you and we have er in that er working group in this specific working group we have identified a few themes erm the the the the most recent document's been written b- by [S6] er a document which hh er er very systematically analy- analyzes all these all these themes i would onl- li- like to mention the common language i mean the word recognition in international recognition means something different from recognition as you use it quality assurance or xxx agencies hh erm we are in search of reliable information on quality but also accessible information on quality hh and er third aspect is we also need information fit for purpose because there is a lot of information and there are a lot of information channels but we still need to answer specific questions 
POmtg546:67	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:68	S5:	 hh and then also and that's the problem for recognition people hh across borders i mean everyone er has an idea about the quality more or less of the educational system in his own country hh but how do you explain it er to to to to xxx how do you explain it to other european countries let alone south east asia or er or or australia whatever hh so that's the main problem hh and we are also in use of a platform or forum in which we can discuss these things and come up with new er problems issues hh such as transnational education that was something we tried to tackle in the er cooperation with [org3] hh but now of course we erm want to follow the developments er on the level of the o e c d and [org4] 
POmtg546:69	S6:	 yah 
POmtg546:70	S5:	 erm we also discussed the problem of non-degree programs in some countries those non-degree programs that are programs which lead which do not lead to a degree but xx erm erm still are hh er a a a huge er reservoir of programs erm er how can we er trust the quality of these non-degree programs if they are in many countries not er subjected to er to quality assessment or to accreditation 
POmtg546:71	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:72	S5:	 in er only very few countries this is the case hh er joint degree programs another er er other issue which we have er coped with in in another document which also has been er er included in the annexes so these are things with which we erm have to have to cope with in one way or the other and then we really need quality assurance agencies quality assurance people hh to help us out it's the [org3] er it's the [org5] it's it will be the [org6] probably hh er but also er other initiatives like joint quality initiative and tuning project et cetera hh and then i come to the second paragraph to paragraph eight hh and there are more or less the dreams of erm er er recognition people depicted i mean what we would like to to have is a or are quality assurance or accreditation s- systems which erm give access to all the educational providers so er er public institutions private institutions perhaps even transnational institutions in some countries some national systems that's one all providers but also to all types of education as i said non-degree but also degree programs 
POmtg546:73	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:74	S5:	 or degree this is is is is is the regular format xxxx hh so there's a second er aspect and third aspect is that erm we need quality assurance systems of which the outcomes are made public of course public and again coming back to my remark on fitness for purpose hh erm made public in a way that is also comprehendable for foreign users erm so that's more or less in a nutshell er our perspective of the er quality issue or accreditation issue how we perceive it and what are our needs for the future in a way we are users of quality assurance agencies end users like the students like the employers and we try to provide the bridges to our own clients and to up- target groups across borders that's it 
POmtg546:75	S1:	 yes thank you both of you er hh yes and er er it is very nice to have positive consumers out there er for the work of the quality assurance agencies but but perhaps there are also expectations which are at a high level it's erm i would like to to er to identify one one interesting implication in what you said [S5] that's as as you said so o e c d [org4] tuning quality hh framework whatever but that's actually what adds up to s- some of the difficulties because quality assurance agencies and their public reports other initiatives are not necessari- -ly compatible hh in er in the sense of what you're goi- going to use so er it's where i see some of the difficulties er approaching er not least actually [org4] or o e c d initiatives er hh which to me is to an extent in a sligh- slightly different world x hh than what we're doing in europe is is very loose is very descriptive er hh were you in er paris for this er yes 
POmtg546:76	S5:	 mhm 
POmtg546:77	S1:	 yes i mean 
POmtg546:78	SX:	 hm 
POmtg546:79	S5:	 mhm 
POmtg546:80	S1:	 very nice level of ambition but er sort of hh not much xxx i just g- got an email x whether i could identify the list of recognized danish institutions huh oh i guess that mail er didn't have the time but has po- probably been circulated through a hundred countries huh and what what would be the feedback in terms of hh what you were talking about hh public publi- public sort of visibility of real quality of the of of programs and institutions hh so in in a sense i see this is a er is a difficulty for you i mean we have a at one time a fairly con- concentrated european process now an- and then we have a much more di- which has its diffuse elements as well because in that sense tuning is a diffuse element at the time being at least hh and then we have an international development which is not very sort of hh precise er either at the moment so erm i guess it adds up to the question i mean how wha- what kind of priorities will you be able to make in the [org1] [org2]s in terms of er where to identify the the real criter- criteria for credible information on qualities 
POmtg546:81	S5:	 do you want to take that or shall i xx 
POmtg546:82	S7:	 no no but i i really had a follow-up to what [S1] just said because in a sense it's also a question of following up from the developments with regard to educational systems because the the traditional sys- 
POmtg546:83	S1:	 yes 
POmtg546:84	S7:	 hh situation in europe has been that you have er an institution a program belonging to a national higher education system and the traditional assumption is even that hh since a generation ago this tended to be a public institution publicly funded hh and everybody knows that no government ever spends money on an unworthy 
POmtg546:85	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:86	S7:	 er top er unworthy er receivers so the assumption was it was funded it was also a good quality and then of course hh there was a er development to private higher education there was a need for assessment of the quality and then hh one thought that well maybe there was a reason for assessing public institutions also but the developments that we're now seeing 
POmtg546:87	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:88	S7:	 is that there is an increasing number of qualifications at least 
POmtg546:89	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:90	S7:	 emanating from providers that are not linked to a national system and we cannot simply say that these are of bad quality or we don't know anything about them so we cannot assess them we have to find ways of assessing them 
POmtg546:91	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:92	S7:	 er and to do that we really need to know something about the quality of the provider erm and we know that many of these providers are of substandard quality they're degree mills but they are less than serious institutions but we also know that some of them may be of good quality erm and we need a way to cope with that i mean the the emergence of for-profit providers linked or not linked to a national system er internet providers et cetera is is a rapidly growing phenomenon erm and there is seems to be a tendency at least in some parts of the labor market to say that higher educati- traditional higher education institutions are too set in the ways we like the analytive approach and they don't look very much at what is behind the analytive approach so we have to find some way to assess that and th- the difficulty that we came we have come up with is in fact that we don't know anything about the quality of those institutions hh and but on the other hand if we say that to be able to assess a qualification we have to know something about the quality we would preferably like to deal with institutions that have been quality-assessed i mean i- if if that becomes government policy but on the other hand those governments have to give the new providers an opportunity actually to undergo quality assessment xx y- you cannot 
POmtg546:93	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:94	S7:	 make er quality assessment a requirement if on the other hand you don't give the people the providers an opportunity to be quality-assessed and this is 
POmtg546:95	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:96	S7:	 i think a very increasingly important topic that is of common concern to us 
POmtg546:97	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:98	S1:	 yes [S8] 
POmtg546:99	S8:	 hh thank you you asked us about the expectations so i i just recollect the er [place8] seminar on er qualifications frameworks hh a year ago er and er the idealized view of the recognition working group in that seminar was that the er national qualifications frameworks set the expected learning outcomes then comes quality assurance and confirms that those outcomes have been reached hh 
POmtg546:100	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:101	S8:	 and then the er credential evaluator only has the the task to rightly place that qualification in the 
POmtg546:102	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:103	S8:	 hh system 
POmtg546:104	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:105	S8:	 that's one extreme and i i understood even more today that er european quality assurance systems are hh not all of them are going towards program accreditation so forget er the idea that it will all one day work like that 
POmtg546:106	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:107	S8:	 hh i will remind the other extreme which i already mentioned the other extreme is that there is some person at the ministry of education or maybe in the best case at the [org1] [org2] center who compiles the lists of what is recognized in the country without er defined criteria 
POmtg546:108	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:109	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:110	S8:	 we will always be in between but if we understand wh- so er the cooperation between quality assurance and recognition is to try to get as close as possible to that hh er hh er option of er er hh i mean th- the positive extreme hh er it will never work that way but but as m- more we know hh maybe it's enough to know that er the quality assurance agencies recognize each other and they that they work in the countries 
POmtg546:111	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:112	S8:	 hh that could be a solution for the time being hh but the er so er so hh well i think i already said what i wanted to @@ so i start rep- repeating myself 
POmtg546:113	S1:	 yah yah yes 
POmtg546:114	S1:	 i think we we we get the picture yes other comments [S9] and then [S10] 
POmtg546:115	S9:	 thank you erm i think in your pursuit of the ideal erm y- one has to recognize the countervailing forces that any hh er any higher education system is is being faced with that's perfectly fine which is on the one hand the need to establish their own credibility and their own credibility within their national systems and international hh at the same time that er has to be done in a way which minimizes the cost to them and indeed the burden of time

POmtg546:130	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:131	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:132	S9:	 er i- i- it is obviou- it is it is a system which reflects both the traditions the needs the expectations and the structures hh er of itself hh er a- a- a- and its history what i think one needs to do is to is to emphasize and get get national systems on whatever level whether it's through governments or agencies or [org2] whatever to identify lockers of responsibility who is responsible hh for quality who is respons- who where does the buck stop in some countries the buck stops at the at the erm ministry in others it stops at the higher education system itself yet others will s- will stop with perhaps erm professional er bodies and so on and i think the important thing is to rec- is to get those who are responsible to recognize their responsibility hh and then to provide to provide the reassurance that's needed at the appropriate level hh so erm i mean if i can just just cite the developments in the u k at the moment in in particular xx it bears exactly of what's being said er our government has has has been interested in in changing the er regulations for degree-awarding powers the institution the criteria by which institutions can award their own degrees hh and it's particularly interested in opening up the market to non-publicly funded providers 
POmtg546:133	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:134	S9:	 and er traditionally of course we do not accredit in the u k there are various 
POmtg546:135	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:136	S9:	 ways in which an institution gets the powers to award its degree hh and having done that it's publicly funded it's subject to [org13]'s reviews from time to time 
POmtg546:137	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:138	SX-f:	 hm 
POmtg546:139	S9:	 hh but the government has for the first time recognized that for a private provider hh the checks and balances provided by being a publicly funded institution weren't hold and therefore it is proposing that for those private providers the right to award a degree should be limited to six years and renewable thereafter hh er and renew the renew mechanism would be hinge upon their erm performance in a standard [org13] audit so that's erm an- and interestingly we've already got expressions of interest from from particular professional bodies but to take up [S7]'s point about how they get into the position of being able to 
POmtg546:140	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:141	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:142	S9:	 to do it er to be assessed in the first place to get the get the track record one of the requirements one of the criteria for consideration of a private or indeed a public organization seeking powers for the first time is they should have worked an apprenticeship with a recognized body with a body with powers hh through er a validation arrangement over at least x it's five years hh and have have developed in in tandem with the er with the er university o- o- or colleges as mentor developed the full quality assurance systems to meet the criteria that any institution's going to need to meet so that's one way in which that's being ad- er addressed but what it does mean in the u k is for the first time ever there'll be a class of higher education institutions that have renewable powers to award degrees 
POmtg546:143	S11:	 hm 
POmtg546:144	S9:	 so in that sense it's an accreditation system that's being introduced 
POmtg546:145	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:146	S9:	 although the regular universities are getting very twitchy x this is they see this is the xxxxx hh and er wha- what's happening to private institutions now what happens to them in future 
POmtg546:147	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:148	S9:	 and of course they are absolutely xx against introducing that but it is possible to divide systems to take account of these things although it has to be said that these will not deal with the question of program certification because they the whole principle as you know er in the u k is that hh each institution is responsible for its own degrees you're getting no national degree it's an institutional degree and therefore it's the institutions that are responsible for the quality assurance of their own programs and it's the way they do that that's a subject of public erm er review and er a- a- a- a- and assessment but erm but that is x the reason i mention that is because it's an attempt to deal with the question of cost the question of over- of overregulation and we are now subject to x my agency is subject to a better regulation review group xxxxx higher ed- higher education regulatory review group whose sole purpose is to reduce the amount of quality assurance xxx institution and this is a government xx which is saying no we ha- it's got to be absolutely the minimum necessary to do the job 
POmtg546:149	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:150	S9:	 and anything we want to propose now has to be view- has to be r- reviewed by the higher education regulatory review and if they don't like it they will make a public statement criticizing us for being too er xxxx institutions so there's a countervailing force at least in the u k against too much detailed assessment of what universities are doing 
POmtg546:151	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:152	S1:	 this prompted several comments but first it was you [S10] and then [S5] 
POmtg546:153	S10:	 so my comment is er more or less er the problem which is set by xxx erm this i see between er evaluations of more or less input-based evaluations we do because there are requirements to con- concern more on more output and capabilities which would be helpful to hh er to diploma recognition but unfortunately at the moment er in reality we are able to assess in a very well input but but er xxx we look in profiles and try to somehow understand er quality of or capabilities of students hh but if er considering er real evaluation of study programs er the inputs is stressed until now fairly and output is somehow mentioned 
POmtg546:154	SX-3:	 @
POmtg546:155	S10:	 xx because it's more difficult it's so hh so this is probably the major problem in helping [org2] and [org1] in in assessing what we are doing 
POmtg546:156	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:157	S1:	 before you take the floor [S5] just i mean an additional comment because taken up on what you sai- said [S8] that what about the situation where more and more agencies do not do program reviews 
POmtg546:158	S8:	 mhm 
POmtg546:159	S1:	 in terms of this process and others have commented on it hh and as xxx mention later er un- er under the next item we have been sitting over some months with the european university association and the students in these quadripartite meetings and there's been an interest because surprise surprise the european university association they go all for institution reviews hh and the students go all for program reviews so the great cooperation between students and universities 
POmtg546:160	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:161	S1:	 unfortunately fail on this very important issue @
POmtg546:162	S4:	
POmtg546:163	SX-m:	 @@@
POmtg546:164	S1:	 but basically i mean wha- as as [S9] says it is w- we could have s- s- hh incredible national quality assurance systems where the agencies make sure that universities are credible quality assurers of their programs i mean we we may in a sort of metalevel s- have the universities do the job which quality assurance agencies do in other countries i mean we hh the it all depends on the quality of the institution reviews or the audits er we are setting up so so in that sense i do not necessarily see a conflict between the two perspectives but it's

POmtg546:170	S5:	 yes 
POmtg546:171	S1:	 and then [S4] 
POmtg546:172	S5:	 erm i would like to in a way erm come back to to your concern but also to your concern xx in your first remark about your mentioning tuning and er quality and everything hh the problem is that it's very difficult to er discuss quality assurance from a perspective of recognition in a very er isolated er fashion i mean it's not only we are not looking for a quality assurance system or the system hh that should answer all other questions i mean if if that's the impression then then it's wrong hh credential evaluation at this moment is focusing on 
POmtg546:173	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:174	S5:	 credentials from the regular er systems so it's a sort of er comparison between systems in a way 
POmtg546:175	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:176	S5:	 hh in some ten or fifteen years we are going to er er to evaluate individuals persons because it will not be possible to track all the erm regular c- courses non-regular courses et cetera hh we are going erm to erm hh address their competencies which is even more than learning outcomes cos that's education x we are going to erm assess their competencies hh acquired in regular education and there we need quality assurance system accreditation 
POmtg546:177	SX:	 hm 
POmtg546:178	S5:	 in hh er non-formal education then we also need partly quality assurance and accreditation systems hh er but also informal systems even work-based an- and work experience hh and then we are looking for alternatives of course but erm m- m- more or less they all should come back in a sort of qualifications framework based on competences and this qualifications framework would hh should in one 
POmtg546:179	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:180	S5:	 way or the other provide bridges between let's say lifelong learning informal non-formal and formal qualifications hh for us that's also part of this quality issue hh 
POmtg546:181	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:182	S5:	 so erm of course we are trying to get as much as possible from you and we would like to say 
POmtg546:183	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:184	S5:	 do as much as possible and then we are happy i b- but we also know that in that it's impossible that it will not solve our problems 
POmtg546:185	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:186	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:187	S5:	 hh so what i would like to say quality is much broader than only what we're discussing here 
POmtg546:188	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:189	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:190	S5:	 but again er the quality assurance systems that erm er mutually recognizes each other xxx er as a system or their decisions in the case of of of [org6] hh are very much helpful for our work but i do know that there are of course limits to what you can do as an accreditation and quality assurance agency is that you cannot solve all our problems hh it's just l- little bit too 
POmtg546:191	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg546:192	S5:	 hh xx some of the nuances 
POmtg546:193	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg546:194	S1:	 i see the point [S4] 
POmtg546:195	S4:	 no i was just er thinking that hh there are other parts of the world where er er or i mean we all know that but other p- parts of the world are are coping or trying to cope with the same problems that we are er here and hh and some of them are some of the big importers and exporters of education especially and that's where we hh er that's where our interests cross so to speak the recognition people and and and and quality assurance people hh er and one of them er i don't know them all there are probably more but one of them er is australia where they have a lot of export and import of education hh they have a qualification framework for the whole educational sector they have h- they've had that for many years that's a responsibility of the institutions hh to make sure that they fulfil the er e- expectations in the qualification framework hh and it is also the the institutions er yeah the institutions er who are expected to to fulfil that and then the hh the audits hh that are done by the national audit er unit or er they will have to check that mechanisms are in place so that all this is achieved so hh i mean one thing and i don't kn- if know if this has been done i'm not on safe ground here hh but i mean one thing which could perhaps be done without spending too much resources on it could be to see how are these problems that we're discussing solved er in other places or hh how far advanced are the discussions in other parts of the world 
POmtg546:196	S1:	 [S7] [S7] 
POmtg546:197	S7:	 hm hh but i think [S9]'s point about reducing the cost is is obviously a g- a great concern to all of us and in terms of the recognition of qualification i think you wer- xx we said earlier it's it's a composite of various factors 
POmtg546:198	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:199	S7:	 hh and of course in assessing a qualif- an individual qualification you have to assess each of those factors but the less time you actually need to xxxxxx 
POmtg546:200	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:201	S7:	 the better served you will be and the less cost it will be both in terms of the resources spent by the agency that does that but also to the individual applicant who will have to wait less time for an outcome and that is hh in fact crucial er imagine if if the purpose of asking for recognition is er for the purpose of further studies er the person would be badly served if in fact er it took er it were faster to take the exams at the host country rather than to wait for the outcome of the 
POmtg546:202	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:203	S7:	 er of the erm of the assessment hh and the quality assessment is an important factor here so we would be greatly helped if there were acc- a s- a xx of accessible and publicly available statements that would say something about the quality of institutional program and i don't think we're aiming for certainly not a ranking we're certainly not aiming for

POmtg546:207	S7:	 hh range i think we're really talking about er minimum standards i think we're also talk- talking about a situation where erm there there're two opposite trends there is a tendency hh to try to devise study programs and opportunities for each student to find a combination of programs and subjects that fit his or her individual interests and aspirations but on the other hand hh if you take that to the extreme it becomes almost impossible to assess so you need a framework to make sense of this diversity you need a fr- you need a framework within which you can describe this variety hh and i think that's part of the rationale xx hh behind developing a qualifications framework whether that's at national level or an overarching

POmtg546:360	S1:	 fairly interesting se- several of you would be able to share my my er my feelings at the moment of hh introducing this hh th- the next point is slightly more difficult because i mean there there's no we we and or i should add in the case when a mem- an agency does not after review or after have been xx by the board's admission er a group does not meet the membership criteria there'll be a one two three year probation period for whatever er the non-meeting of criteria er i- is concerned and after that hh that period there'll be a a a a new a new hh look at er at the agency hh but the final thing i'll mention to that i- is the sort of metaeuropean capacity and you can well ask as [S9] [S9/last] repeatedly asked me what should we do with a metaeuropean capacity but it's it is out there it's a very strong part of the platform of the other four three es that there must be in some way a construction where university students er other stakeholders are have a representative dimension in in relation to what we are doing in in the quality er assurance network hh and as i understand it and my own meetings in in the bologna follow-up group this is a widely shared sentiment among several of of the of the government representatives that part of the idea of this peer review is a broader stakeholder involvement hh so what what we are coming up with and er wi- will in some form or other er finally to be decided in in a meeting in the work group tomorrow hh is a construction where we have a group wi- with members er with representatives from [org10] [org7] and [org8] possibly other stakeholders possibly the commission hh er and this group will have the c- occasion t- to give one example to comment on the reviews so hh if the danish agency has been reviewed and there is the necessary public report it will be possible for this group to comment on the report and xxx this group's suggestions in terms of follow-up on the report hh this personally i think is is a fair way of er moving them in on our hh way of thinking and doing things without transferring some kind of sanctionary power to to x the construction which i think would be difficult to handle in er the practicalities we we'll find ourselves in hh but it it's er probably the most complicated part is of it is to set up some kind of hh as i tried to use the term metaeuropean construction give it some operationality but at the same t- time hh not run the risk of providing it with a very low credibility because most of the essential decisions in issues concerning agencies and their future or non-future will be taken at a national level i mean that's a fact i'm sure we cannot escape

POmtg546:406	S9:	 yah 
POmtg546:407	S9:	 but but the other thing you can't avoid is er i mean at the moment [org10] has set up its quality committee which proposes i think still proposes to undertake some kind of evaluation 
POmtg546:408	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:409	S9:	 xx how 
POmtg546:410	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:411	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:412	S9:	 of agencies 
POmtg546:413	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:414	S9:	 well i think that's just not credible on the other hand i think it's also not credible hh for any for the work of the agencies not to be not to be er f- er er xxx not to be er a scrutiny of the work of the agencies not to be looked at at least in some respect it'd be considered in some respect by those for who we're providing service which includes the institutions themselves 
POmtg546:415	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:416	S9:	 hh so i think there has to be some level at which the
POmtg546:417	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:418	S9:	 at which the erm institutions however represented whether through national er representative organizations 
POmtg546:419	SX-m:	 yah 
POmtg546:420	S9:	 or through european representative organizations 
POmtg546:421	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg546:422	S9:	 well there must be a question mark as to how representative the [org10] itself is actually erm er er er at some level in this whole process there has to be some engagement or involvement with the with the institutions and their representatives hh so a question is what is the best way of doing that 
POmtg546:423	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg546:424	S9:	 hh certainly i don't think they can have any kind of summative power over the agencies because 
POmtg546:425	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:426	S9:	 erm i- it's whoever owns the agencies that has that power that ca- er er xxxxxxxxxxx 
POmtg546:427	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg546:428	S11:	 x 
POmtg546:429	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:430	S9:	 at the same time i think it would be unrealistic and probably quite wrong simply to ignore xx the institutions themselves from some part of the process so it is a question of getting at a balance between giving them a role in the process but at the same time not giving them a dominant role 
POmtg546:431	S1:	 exactly a balance which i'm sure we can achieve once we found the right words to d- describe it yes hh so hh other comments
POmtg546:432	S11:	 xx er er er maybe i miss i just missed the point but why is that so difficult for most of our er for most of the members er it seems so er 
POmtg546:433	S9:	 rational 
POmtg546:434	S11:	 yah er y- y- it's no not it's more than that it's not fashionable 
POmtg546:435	S9:	 no xx not fashionable rational 
POmtg546:436	S11:	 oh sorry rational sorry 
POmtg546:437	S9:	 x x yes it's rational 
POmtg546:438	S11:	 erm 
POmtg546:439	S9:	 well i hope it's all right that we will accept this 
POmtg546:440	S11:	 what would be the problem with that because er er except for the fact that you er if you're going to look for an hh an organization that is that's the metaevaluation if but if there is a 
POmtg546:441	S9:	 hm 
POmtg546:442	S11:	 a proper national evaluation 
POmtg546:443	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:444	S11:	 procedure in which the stakeholders are 
POmtg546:445	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:446	S11:	 conceived 
POmtg546:447	S9:	 hm 
POmtg546:448	S11:	 a part of students and the universities and the high sch- the schools of professional education in our sense hh employers' organizations 
POmtg546:449	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:450	S11:	 for instance will be 
POmtg546:451	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:452	S11:	 a part of the evaluation committees in the netherlands 
POmtg546:453	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:454	S9:	 hm 
POmtg546:455	S11:	 and maybe the inspector of higher education as a 
POmtg546:456	S1:	 yah 
POmtg546:457	S11:	 that will be it wh- why more than that why would you like to go to a kind of a metaevaluation 
POmtg546:458	S1:	 because as i'm glad [S9] supports me because i- it is there as xx er when we had most of these meetings in [place7] hh and as er people x in [place7] they tend sometimes to forget that there is such a thing as a national context background hh and er there is a tendency 
POmtg546:459	S4:	 hm 
POmtg546:460	S1:	 i mean the commission by the way has its own agenda in this er these matters hh but the [org10] and the students at that level wish very much for this to have a european dimension obviously because that would give the organizations as such a a stronger hand so when we as we do come up with a @ very good argument that stakeholder involvement would be xx cases 
POmtg546:461	SX:	
POmtg546:462	S1:	 naturally solved at a national basis when organizing a national review of the agency you can still feel that this is not enough
POmtg546:463	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:464	SX-10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:465	S1:	 hh and er the the problem is that when we introduce into such a context of as the bologna follow- -up group the contrast between national realities and the european visions as i hear it there's a surprising tendency for the european vision to come out stronger in the arguments than the national realities so i'm back to my point if we do not put in something which meets these expectations 
POmtg546:466	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:467	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:468	S1:	 then others will and they may not be 
POmtg546:469	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:470	S1:	 hh as deft at hh doing this with the right wordings and the right balance as as er as the [org3] er membership will be able to do it so it's in that sense that's a very political explanation to this 
POmtg546:471	S9:	 hh but 
POmtg546:472	S9:	 i think 
POmtg546:473	SX-6:	 hm 
POmtg546:474	S9:	 i think that the er the the the trick that we got to try and pull off is to not call it a metaevaluation 
POmtg546:475	SX-m:	 @
POmtg546:476	S9:	 because a metaevaluation involves 
POmtg546:477	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:478	S9:	 a review itself 
POmtg546:479	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:480	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:481	S9:	 erm and possibly a judgement which i think is what has to be avoided but i think what one can do is offer it 
POmtg546:482	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:483	S9:	 as information on national systems er th- the review report would go to er er er er er er er er a europe-wide stakeholder body for information and comment 
POmtg546:484	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:485	S9:	 i mean xxx to stop such a good commenting on the reports 
POmtg546:486	S11:	 no it's not 
POmtg546:487	S9:	 in whatever way they felt appropriate 
POmtg546:488	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:489	S11:	 yah okay okay fine 
POmtg546:490	S9:	 but they would not be in the position to to make judgements about this 
POmtg546:491	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:492	S1:	 no no but that i hope i made that point clear 
POmtg546:493	S9:	 i i think that would be they have no authority to xxxxxxxx xxx 
POmtg546:494	S1:	 no no 
POmtg546:495	S10:	 mhm this is problem 
POmtg546:496	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:497	S9:	 or to claim an authority they don't have but it i think it is right that their views are looked to and er er er xxxx reporting 
POmtg546:498	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:499	S1:	 hh yes [S10] 
POmtg546:500	S10:	 erm there is hh one problem i don't have problems er with erm a kind of metaevaluation call it so or not erm and procedures are quite hh understandable and must be in fact it's a problem of legitimation as well the involvement of stakeholders xx i fully agree hh but there is then the problem of consequences and authorization er what about agencies which er don't meet requirements but in v- very important er ways s- so what what else what then because x these are usually somehow legitimized at a national level but er are if they are not recognized fully at 
POmtg546:501	S9:	 but 
POmtg546:502	S9:	 but th- the basic purpose of all this is to is for the membership of [org3] it's entirely voluntary nobody is required to xx [org3] 
POmtg546:503	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:504	SX-m:	 xx 
POmtg546:505	S9:	 so it is about membership of [org3] 
POmtg546:506	SX-4:	 hm 
POmtg546:507	S9:	 but in a sense it's it's making membership of [org3] 
POmtg546:508	SX-4:	 exactly 
POmtg546:509	S4:	 yes 
POmtg546:510	S9:	 a de facto xx accreditation of an agency 
POmtg546:511	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:512	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:513	S4:	 yes 
POmtg546:514	S9:	 so one doesn't one might say i don't p- approve of any this i don't want to be a member of [org3] 
POmtg546:515	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:516	S4:	 hm 
POmtg546:517	S9:	 i don't want to have anything to do with it 
POmtg546:518	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:519	S4:	 yes 
POmtg546:520	S9:	 xxxxx 
POmtg546:521	S4:	 yes 
POmtg546:522	S9:	 xxx cos if you do that then you distance yourself from the mainstream activities going on in europe 
POmtg546:523	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:524	S9:	 so so there has to be a benefit of the cost 
POmtg546:525	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:526	S1:	 xx 
POmtg546:527	S9:	 and you have to balance where 
POmtg546:528	SX-1:	 hm 
POmtg546:529	S9:	 one's one agency xx i guess very few will want to be outside [org3] 
POmtg546:530	S10:	 mhm that's true 
POmtg546:531	S1:	 hh but [S10] i mean it's it's a very good point because as i have said earlier today we are as we evolve going to have a more heterogeneous er membership we are going to have some new x we were all new ones xx i mean no one started out perfect @ doing this job 
POmtg546:532	SX-10:	 hm 
POmtg546:533	S1:	 so we have to find a common denominator in terms of the quality of agencies which is not too er discriminatory towards new agencies that's why i'm slightly i may have misunderstood you [S11] but that's why the idea that the [org6] sets up its own review system xx t- to its own code of practices to me would give the hh not too pleasing a a prospect of sort of several layers within [org3] we're all [org3] members but some of us have more refined er er er qualification structures than others that would not be a happy day for fo- for the network in that sense hh because as a network with forty-one plus and growing members as i said the common denominator must not hh be put at the level of the agencies that's been in place for ten years or more i mean that's 
POmtg546:534	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:535	S1:	 at least my very personal view on o- o- on this one hh so erm i mean to quote [S9] er who uses the term no there is not one size fits all in in in terms of european agencies xx so if we x make one size at a very high level then we will run into 
POmtg546:536	S4:	
POmtg546:537	S1:	 great problems and e- eventually great problems with the credibility of the network as such so i'm good you glad you took up that point 
POmtg546:538	S11:	 but don't xx if the ministers are asking us to find out a a system of quality assurance which is compatible a little bit compatible 
POmtg546:539	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:540	S11:	 if they would ask us as a national authorities or national bodies or agencies give us the procedure in which you will be evaluated in er 
POmtg546:541	S9:	 er i i actually said that you know they didn't ask us for a single procedure 
POmtg546:542	S11:	 no not a single procedure er erm 
POmtg546:543	S9:	 they asked us for er an assurance that th- th- evaluation was taking place of agencies 
POmtg546:544	S11:	 yes but if so if if they would ask the national bodies or the national authority
POmtg546:545	S9:	 yeah 
POmtg546:546	S11:	 let's see in what way you are as a national agency [org13] 
POmtg546:547	S9:	 yah 
POmtg546:548	S11:	 will be evaluated with the erm er erm use of use of the stakeholders stakeholders are involved in that 
POmtg546:549	S9:	 yah 
POmtg546:550	S9:	 yah 
POmtg546:551	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:552	S11:	 and there's a kind of an let's say the advisory role of [org3] on let's say erm of whether the procu- procedure fits th- the general goal why wouldn't that be enough why would you have a er a standard above that because it could easily er could quite well be that th- that the way we are evaluating our system er leans m- m- more heavy on students leans more heavy on institutions 
POmtg546:553	S9:	 yah 
POmtg546:554	S11:	 than maybe your system 
POmtg546:555	S9:	 hh the object of the exercise the object of the [place4] mandate i think is to try and bring the level of quality assurance generally a bit nearer up to an acceptable standard for all countries 
POmtg546:556	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:557	S9:	 hh and some will be above what is an acceptable standard and some may have to 
POmtg546:558	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:559	S9:	 work towards reaching the acceptable standard 
POmtg546:560	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:561	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:562	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:563	S1:	 mhm 
POmtg546:564	S9:	 erm er but for that there hav- there has to be standard 
POmtg546:565	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:566	S9:	 hh and the standard is x the idea is that standards should be manifested in the [org3] 
POmtg546:567	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:568	S9:	 membership criteria 
POmtg546:569	SX-m:	 mhm 
POmtg546:570	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:571	S9:	 you could have [org3] as a fully inclusive organization hh which anybody joins simply for the the professional benefit 
POmtg546:572	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:573	S9:	 and then have if you'd like an accreditation list hh of those who meet certain standards they would be the accredited x er xx that'd be 
POmtg546:574	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:575	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:576	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:577	S9:	 that would be a possibility but the er the general view i think certainly i think in the quadripartite group hh was that they would want [org3] membership hh to be itself de facto accreditation status so that nobody within [org3] who didn't reach a certain who couldn't demonstrate a certain requirement 
POmtg546:578	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:579	S9:	 what that requirement is of course 
POmtg546:580	S10:	 n-n 
POmtg546:581	S9:	 is the is the question 
POmtg546:582	S11:	 xx 
POmtg546:583	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:584	S9:	 and i think in fact 
POmtg546:585	S10:	 hm 
POmtg546:586	S9:	 when when when we see them or if we see that the the criteria themselves are fairly generic and but but entirely reasonable 
POmtg546:587	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:588	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:589	S10:	 mhm 
POmtg546:590	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:591	S9:	 erm and it's not going to be a a detailed list of things you must do 
POmtg546:592	S11:	 no 
POmtg546:593	S9:	 hh we should be quite wrong i mean i think 
POmtg546:594	S11:	 no 
POmtg546:595	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:596	S9:	 there's a difference between saying you must reach a certain standard and this is how you're going to do it 
POmtg546:597	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:598	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:599	S9:	 because that does take away er the autonomy of individual agencies erm so i think i think the level of er of of generality of the criteria is appropriate 
POmtg546:600	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:601	S9:	 hh and i don't think anybody is likely to have too much difficulty if on the other hand of course 
POmtg546:602	SX-m:	 hm 
POmtg546:603	S9:	 er the erm there is no national review process of the agencies 
POmtg546:604	S11:	 mhm 
POmtg546:605	S9:	 and er and er and an agency is is dependent on the [org3] model 
POmtg546:606	S11:	 yah 
POmtg546:607	S9:	 then of course it's the [org3] model 
POmtg546:608	S11:	 that's another one okay 
POmtg546:609	S1:	 hm 
POmtg546:610	S9:	 er that's what you'd have to p- abide by 
POmtg546:611	S11:	 yah okay 
POmtg546:612	S11:	 yah i see 
POmtg546:613	S9:	 but that's not the only model xxxxx it's not the exclusive one 
POmtg546:614	SX-10:	 hm
