# Comparing English speech of native and non-native speakers
In this project, I compare the speech of native and non-native speakers of English. I use two different corpora -- the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE), which contains conversations between mostly non-native English speakers, and the spoken files of the British Nation Corpus (BNC), which contain conversations between native English speakers. I make comparisons between bigrams and the hesitations between speakers in VOICE and BNC. I also make these comparisons between different L1 groups in VOICE -- Germanic L1s, Romance L1s, and Slavic L1s.
