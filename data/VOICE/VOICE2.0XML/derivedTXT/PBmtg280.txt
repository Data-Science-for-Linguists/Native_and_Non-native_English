PBmtg280:1	S1:	 x here and fifty per cent here so basically what you have to do 
PBmtg280:2	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:3	S1:	 for a quarter you take this number and multiply it with that yeah so you have twenty-five per cent multiplied with one point zero five eight for example for october 
PBmtg280:4	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:5	S1:	 and then you multiply it with one point one four six for november and the same for december so erm overall the achievements for [org1] and [org2] are somewhere in the range between one hundred five and one hundred fifteen per cent for the period october to december erm this means erm okay if you take that together it's fifty per cent you multiply it with that so finally ah no sorry that was wrong it was erm yeah that's that's right xx so hh erm so you exceed this fifty per cent yeah 
PBmtg280:6	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:7	S1:	 twenty-five plus twenty-five but it's not the limit you can go beyond that and this is what happens so basically erm the the whole q p s e is one hundred per cent 
PBmtg280:8	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:9	S1:	 and you would get not considering the [org3] part something between fifty and fifty-five per cent for october to december
PBmtg280:10	S2:	 so we will get it in march it will be for the 
PBmtg280:11	S1:	 no 
PBmtg280:12	S2:	 last quarter
PBmtg280:13	S1:	 we won't get it 
PBmtg280:14	S3:	 we won't get it 
PBmtg280:15	S1:	 okay there is one important explanation and this is here it's mentioned that these are the numbers for q three yeah hh er you have to understand the business here of [org2] starts in april which means q three is our q four or is let's say the q four of a calendar year
PBmtg280:16	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:17	S1:	 that's q three of the business year of [org2] hh this means it means these are the numbers 
PBmtg280:18	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:19	S1:	 yeah from october to december
PBmtg280:20	S3:	 so first time we will see our name in these statistics is january february march 
PBmtg280:21	S1:	 exactly yeah
PBmtg280:22	S3:	 which is not xx 
PBmtg280:23	S1:	 so we should get the numbers like mid or end of april something like that and then we should see the first time this xx for a year 
PBmtg280:24	S4:	
PBmtg280:25	S1:	 and basically i guess we should here crop up at one of these categories mhm and then when you have this email you can directly calculate how much xxx you will see and of course i mean you have to erm you have to take your overall q p l c amount divided by four yeah cos it's concerning one quarter
PBmtg280:26	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg280:27	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:28	S1:	 is this clear so far
PBmtg280:29	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:30	S1:	 okay erm
PBmtg280:31	S2:	 h- how is the bonus taxed we pay full tax for it or 
PBmtg280:32	S1:	 it's just normal payment yeah 
PBmtg280:33	S2:	 okay 
PBmtg280:34	S1:	 there's no difference 
PBmtg280:35	S2:	 so we also it's also covers some social insurance and other stuff or it's only the 
PBmtg280:36	S3:	 don't the social versicherung taken off for bonus of extra pays it's just tax
PBmtg280:37	S4:	 it depends how they they do and the tax low yeah 
PBmtg280:38	S1:	 it's it's just just a regular part of the salary so i guess it's exactly the same as as salary
PBmtg280:39	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:40	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:41	S4:	 because it's part xx yeah yeah so 
PBmtg280:42	S3:	 so but you don't pay social versicherung for bonuses
PBmtg280:43	S2:	 so the 
PBmtg280:44	S3:	 hm
PBmtg280:45	S4:	 but it's pa- part of the salary though isn't it
PBmtg280:46	S2:	 i don't know xx we have to ask for it 
PBmtg280:47	S1:	 yeah
PBmtg280:48	S4:	 it's it's part you know it's taken 
PBmtg280:49	S3:	 xxxxxx payment is part of the salary but bonus is something extra 
PBmtg280:50	S5:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:51	S4:	 no
PBmtg280:52	S5:	 so it's not treated as a special 
PBmtg280:53	S4:	 in 
PBmtg280:54	S3:	 as much it is 
PBmtg280:55	S4:	 i- in the contract there is part of the salary so what you get is well we'll see i guess 
PBmtg280:56	S1:	 okay are there any other questions today no

PBmtg280:114	S2:	 i mean at [org6] they have these regular checks and blah blah blah things like this they moved to [org7] and i have not really felt that something didn't work i mean from i t side i was just wondering if we if somebody took care of organizational this beforehand be- because now we are losing a lot of money because 
PBmtg280:115	S1:	 yeah okay 
PBmtg280:116	S2:	 i know fifty per cent of people can't work 
PBmtg280:117	S1:	 okay er if you just addressed the move to [org7] that's quite easy because er they don't have the i t any more in [place1] it's in [place3] and they anyway just er connect er remotely so you know that's much easier than moving servers and services and so on 
PBmtg280:118	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:119	S2:	 no okay this we can't really decide because we don't know what's behind it but 
PBmtg280:120	SX-m:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:121	S2:	 what i mean is just a question was anybody taking care of organizing this switch-over 
PBmtg280:122	S1:	 i mean we were not involved in that that's er that's the task of i t and erm i have not discussed that i just know that erm [first name2] has proposed hh erm at least once to move that so it should have been done earlier and he said we are not yet prepared yeah erm so i guess there was some planning yeah 
PBmtg280:123	S2:	 okay 
PBmtg280:124	S3:	 were the changes just i p address switch-overs or is it structural cha- changes also so will we see any benefit in network performance 
PBmtg280:125	S1:	 n- no no it's just i p addresses at the moment hh but in general we had a good discussion last week with the i t integration manager he came here from [place4] hh and er basically they er they plan erm for a period of three months to to look at all the services all the hardware servers and so on and and update that or replace it if necessary so erm in in like three months we should see erm new desktops probably new servers new services so this should be done roughly in in three months something like that yeah hh and we said 
PBmtg280:126	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:127	S1:	 yeah we appreciate that they take some time to do all that erm instead of just changing everything from one day to the next without you know because the the goal is that it's xxx if we have this new structure er it should be easy to just add fifty people to it hm that's the major goal 
PBmtg280:128	S2:	 and is that true that we will all get p cs at s- at some point
PBmtg280:129	S1:	 er that's the standard [org2] solution yeah the er [org2] normally has a p c so erm documentation mail web all that is done on a p c hh and then you just have a citrix login for the design work erm it's not finally decided yet but erm it looks like the most likely solution because erm probably we have the best support if we do that because erm [org2] has only p cs with a maintenance erm contract or support contract erm they have erm what's the english word erm you know remote administration software installed on each p c 
PBmtg280:130	S2:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:131	S1:	 erm so basically the p cs wouldn't be necessarily maintained any more from here but from er from probably the [place5] erm but that's also an advantage because then we have twenty-four seven support we have a standard installation each p c has the same installation we have all programs on the p c and so on so we probably have the best support and these standard tasks could be taken away from our local i t hh to the central i t and then the local guys here can concentrate on the supporting the 
PBmtg280:132	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:133	S2:	 the people with special erm topics 
PBmtg280:134	S2:	 special okay
PBmtg280:135	S3:	 and what happens with all the licences we already have for [org8] are these directly transferable to p c or were they bought xx unix in mind
PBmtg280:136	S1:	 no we we wouldn't work on p c yeah we still have the citrix login to unix to solaris so this this doesn't change we won't do the i mean you don't get the design work on er the design software on p c 
PBmtg280:137	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:138	S1:	 so this we stay on solaris or linux or so 
PBmtg280:139	S5:	 where where will we have the servers here [place5] [place6] or 
PBmtg280:140	S1:	 er which servers
PBmtg280:141	S5:	 [place7] the servers we are going to work on
PBmtg280:142	S1:	 what do you mean with servers
PBmtg280:143	S5:	 big machines to run the tasks on
PBmtg280:144	S1:	 they will be here
PBmtg280:145	S5:	 ah 
PBmtg280:146	S1:	 there is a strategy at [org2] to centralize the i t but that's more mid- or long-term strategy so for the moment the machines would be here erm some services or servers will also move away so for example finally we probably won't have mail servers any more here erm so currently we still have the [org3] mail server and erm the [org2] mails are forwarded to the [org3] mail server but this will change so finally we will directly get the mails or use the mail servers of [org2] in the [place5] 
PBmtg280:147	S2:	 when is it planned
PBmtg280:148	S1:	 don't know what's the schedule
PBmtg280:149	S2:	 okay it's a very good idea actually er i was thinking if i had to stay let's say in [place1] for a couple of days i would not have access to my emails because [org3] doesn't offer the web access and 
PBmtg280:150	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:151	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:152	S2:	 [org2] does
PBmtg280:153	S1:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:154	S1:	 yeah the web access currently is more or less disabled because the mails are forwarded to [org3] yeah as soon as erm the [org3] servers do not exist any more we can also use the webmail then additionally yeah i think everybody who gets a laptop erm so that's currently mainly the project managers will have a v p n installed and then er wherever you can access the internet you can download your emails also but only with the standard [org2] installation not the the old [org3] installation
PBmtg280:155	S4:	 so you you use we know with that erm scenario you can't erm access the development area then from from our v p n 
PBmtg280:156	S1:	 that's not yet set out by [org2] they are currently working on that on a on a solution like 
PBmtg280:157	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg280:158	S1:	 probably tarantella or so 
PBmtg280:159	S4:	 okay yeah whatever 
PBmtg280:160	S1:	 erm but that's ongoing that's not yet solved erm what is important to understand is they distinguish the i t into two parts one is what they call erm i think backbone yeah 
PBmtg280:161	S4:	 infrastructure x 
PBmtg280:162	S1:	 and then the second part is project so the backbone is like the standard installation everybody needs email documentation and so on and that's normally p c and the project then might be for a software project that we need erm a compiler or whatever hh er it might be for a i c design project that you need a complete infrastructure like a unix network licences and so on so that's split yeah so the guys we currently talk to in [place4] they are backbone yeah and er they will now involve somebody from [place8] for for the project yeah and they involve also us for the project requirements 
PBmtg280:163	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:164	S1:	 so that's that's split
PBmtg280:165	S4:	 does that mean that we can then share licences as well then across sites or or is that nothing for future 
PBmtg280:166	S1:	 i think that's that's certainly the future plan but currently we cannot because 
PBmtg280:167	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:168	S1:	 our licences or our our erm licence contracts do not allow that at the moment 
PBmtg280:169	SX-m:	 x x 
PBmtg280:170	S1:	 and the [org2] ones also do not allow it yeah 
PBmtg280:171	S4:	 we don't have multi-site licences 
PBmtg280:172	S1:	 well yeah erm er i mean we have multi-site licences but just for our three sites yeah 
PBmtg280:173	S4:	 ah okay
PBmtg280:174	S1:	 and er [org2] probably has also i think they have multi-site licences but only for [place7] 
PBmtg280:175	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:176	S1:	 because all the the i c design so far is done in [place7] hh so the contracts have to be changed and erm i don't know if you can just change them somewhere in the middle maybe they run till the end and they are changed then 
PBmtg280:177	S4:	 ev- everything negotiable i think yeah 
PBmtg280:178	SX-m:	 especially for [org2] 
PBmtg280:179	S4:	 @ @@@ @@@ @
PBmtg280:180	S1:	 just a matter of money yeah 
PBmtg280:181	S4:	 yeah exactly 
PBmtg280:182	S1:	 and yeah you know the the whole b l s i team is very big that's i think more than thousand people 
PBmtg280:183	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:184	S1:	 but most of them are in the o d cs in the offshore design centers and there they get the licences the infrastructure and everything from the customer erm so the the the real erm 
PBmtg280:185	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:186	S1:	 yeah how to call it design service team which is available for any customer is much much smaller so it's erm they are in a similar situation as we are in terms of licences and infrastructure and so on yeah 
PBmtg280:187	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:188	S4:	 okay
PBmtg280:189	S1:	 so it's not that we suddenly have a a partner with fifteen hundred engineers and erm er ten times more licences than we have that's not the case
PBmtg280:190	S4:	 mhm okay i- is has there any discussion regarding the lab network internet and so on 
PBmtg280:191	S1:	 erm i have er kicked that off erm after the discussion with you 
PBmtg280:192	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:193	S1:	 er we have been discussing that in the r n d management team there is one thing which is also not yet clear erm this business unit [org4] er will do analogue mixed signal i p design and then the i ps probably would have to be characterized and so on and that would be done in the lab so there is still a long list of equipment hhh erm er which is probably bought for the lab which is then erm probably financed by [org4] and not you know by [org5] 
PBmtg280:194	S4:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:195	S1:	 so it's not er let's say the lab responsibility is also not yet clear that's linked to the er to your question that's the erm location of the team downstairs is not yet fully clear in the organization hhh erm but in general yeah we er erm we are discussing that
PBmtg280:196	S4:	 okay 
PBmtg280:197	S1:	 who could be responsible for it erm i think the im- the most important input from your side was erm the the safety in the lab yeah i mean this made us erm y- yeah think about it erm because this should be i mean this should be clear if you go into the lab that somebody gives you an introduction and and so on hh and there is also this discussion with with the i t in the lab yeah i mean you brought up a good point that it might be might be good to lock the lab and then only certain people have access and then er we put the p cs in our normal network and not in this separated network
PBmtg280:198	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:199	S1:	 so there are actually many topics to discuss and we have started that but i don't know how long it takes especially the i t because yeah the time frame is
PBmtg280:200	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:201	S1:	 three months at least 
PBmtg280:202	S4:	 yeah okay mhm 
PBmtg280:203	S3:	 are there any plans to utilize the floor space upstairs because if you are going to bring more work into the lab other groups you don't have enough space there
PBmtg280:204	S4:	 that's a good point yeah @@ you need to make it bigger
PBmtg280:205	S3:	 probably so 
PBmtg280:206	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:207	S3:	 is that spoken about 
PBmtg280:208	S1:	 no there are no concrete clan- er plans to do that but as the the erm third floor second floor is not used otherwise we can do that any time yeah so it's basically no problem in terms of infrastructure and so on 
PBmtg280:209	S3:	 cos that is 
PBmtg280:210	S3:	 controlled access yeah 
PBmtg280:211	S1:	 ah you mean the third floor just for the lab 
PBmtg280:212	S3:	 just for 
PBmtg280:213	S3:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:214	S1:	 okay no that's

PBmtg280:218	S4:	 that room you can make with controlled access as well yeah 
PBmtg280:219	S2:	 twenty per cent of the company only is a lab @

PBmtg280:221	S2:	 okay
PBmtg280:222	S1:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:223	S4:	 you just put your er i d chip in and then it you know locks in and locks in 
PBmtg280:224	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:225	S4:	 yeah we can try that yeah erm but it seems to work okay but it just need to be like a chip card used to be but you can er automatically lock in when you go out so 
PBmtg280:226	S1:	 i mean er it depends on how much we do in the end in the lab
PBmtg280:227	SX-m:	
PBmtg280:228	S1:	 erm you know we also have this wafer prober for example so we are 
PBmtg280:229	S3:	 mhm 
PBmtg280:230	S1:	 we are thinking about utilizing that to to offer that as a service no- not for i mean obviously we cannot do it for for production er like testing production testing er but we could do a characterization qualification er such things on the wafer prober and we had requests from other companies where they were asking whether we can do that for them or not 
PBmtg280:231	S2:	 wafer prober we have wafer prober
PBmtg280:232	S1:	 we have a wafer prober yeah 
PBmtg280:233	S2:	 is this already installed there somewhere
PBmtg280:234	S4:	 yeah 
PBmtg280:235	S3:	 no
PBmtg280:236	S4:	 yeah no 
PBmtg280:237	S3:	 still wrapped up
PBmtg280:238	S1:	 but it seems to be a quite good one actually

PBmtg280:240	S1:	 er for the 
PBmtg280:241	S4:	 we just can make sure that you put in a basement er xxxxxx floor @@@
PBmtg280:242	S1:	 yeah basically we have to take the floor out and put it on the concrete 
PBmtg280:243	S2:	 well okay yeah that's very vibration-sensitive but it is a tester or just a prober
PBmtg280:244	S1:	 it's er ooph
