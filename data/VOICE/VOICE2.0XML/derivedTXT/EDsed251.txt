EDsed251:106	S15:	 xxxxxx 
EDsed251:107	S1:	 even more the oldest still existing german-speaking university in europe because there was only hh one before which was the charles university of prague which has been founded in thirteen forty-eight hh vienna university in thirteen sixty-five er because the duke of austria was the er son-in-law of the german emperor charles sitting in prague and because he wanted to i don't know er

EDsed251:110	SX-f:	 @@@
EDsed251:111	S1:	 in vienna he also competed in other areas but also in higher education er of course the setting was different seven hundred years ago but it was a university basically consisting of of law and er faculty of law a faculty of theology philosophy it was more a general education so students hh have not been specialized as we are today being a lawyer being a hh a doctor being a art historian being a historian or whatever hh er they have been experts for almost everything and yah so the early times of european universities er and it all started sorbonne in paris eleventh century for example or already tenth century hh 
EDsed251:112	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDsed251:113	S1:	 among the oldest in europe then two famous law faculties in europe the hh university of bologna er still today being a leading institution for law studies for international law studies er maybe not by chance it's a nice historical bridge already in the eleventh century a leading european institution of higher education hh is the john hopkins center for for european law and is i guess still today er bologna the second one in padua still university towns today hh er coimbra in portugal and and all those those early universities er and because there have only been a few of them er students from all over europe came to those places to study in the case of padua and bologna law er which in return meant when they went back home they tried to practise what they learned in italy for example what did they learn in italy they learned roman law ancient roman law because this was the only codified hh corpus of of of law available at those times hh er so when they went back to for example i don't know germany hh scandinavia erm slovakia which x has not been slovakia then or or whatever region in europe er we have hh er they practised the law they learned in italy erm 
EDsed251:114	S1:	 so er you see they also already had quite dense networks networks of of of humanists and x trained people being the intellectual elites of of their times hh being as it was the case with erasmus the adviser to to the emperor to the then german emperor er charles the fifth who was at the same time king of spain hh duke of the netherlands duke of austria king of bohemia king of germany and all these kind of regions and areas er so quite influential and important people er having a quite european identity because of the holy roman empire france big territories being integrated or at those times when they started to integrate those territories hh to put a common er administrative structure on a set of territories er introducing the same laws for all the territories they ruled allowing people to to cross borders easily er allowing people to get to know to other people to other cultures languages hh er habits what have you er which definitely has an influence on on one's identity i mean if you're er i don't know sitting in a in a in a little village out of nowhere 
EDsed251:115	SX:	
EDsed251:116	S1:	 all your life without internet which was not available then and without T V which was also not available i mean you stick to the identity of your region but if you have the possibility to hh cross borders to get to know to other regions people er cultures what have you languages erm i think and that's also reflected what i think is also reflected in the hh in the research and the literature which is available on this identity issue hh has quite an impact on on on identity formation or constructing of personal identities or or collective identities you know hh being austrian being european being being slovak being french hh er whatever so the question would be do we face the same kind of influence
EDsed251:117	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDsed251:118	S1:	 because of today's european integration and because of today's hh integration of higher education within european integration hh do we experience the same kind of influence on on constructing formation of er individual and collective identities maybe it is also a first kind of question to you what what you feel about it or how if you see a link there is this er term of european reintegration you know some historians call the recent development of european integration since the hh end of the second world war european reintegration exactly because of the reason hh that they say before the era of nationalism europe was already economically er as regards higher education as i tried to explain hh er what have you was already very and highly integrated and this was lost somehow because national states started er to to i don't know close their doors you know and and having u- not using the the roman law as it was the case in a big empire like the holy roman empire hh but introducing a national legal system for example introducing a national education system hh er teaching the pupils in school national history not european history and all that having big influences on on what we think and what we feel to be actually huh do you see the point
EDsed251:119	SX-m:	 yes 
EDsed251:120	S1:	 so some historians made an argument that we are in an era or phase of european reintegration so the question for our topic european higher integration would be do we also face a phase of european reintegration in the field of higher education hh or do you see this impact of having the chance to study abroad on on ourselves on our identity on the identity of our societies because the more people from austria from slovakia from germany from france from turkey hh going abroad on a student mobility period or what have you or even working abroad hh erm the more people that do so the more maybe it influences the hh the shape of the whole society xx what we are and what we think that we'd be how how do you think about it
EDsed251:121	S18:	 well i think that this is a kind of erm very idealistic approach to er today and a kind of erm constru- construct erm of erm of the past because you have to imagine i think that erm in er the middle ages there was something called erm well we call it in er german personenverbandsstaat or hh i mean personal 
EDsed251:122	SS:	 @@@@@
EDsed251:123	S18:	 erm bonds between er rulers and and subjects and so on so for example in one town there were subjects of the monastery er well i don't know some monastery hh er then there were subjects of er one bishop subjects of one duke and so on and they all were hh in some way interrelated which is almost unimaginable for us today hh so i think this was a kind of total er totally er different reality in the middle ages and yeah that's that's xx the point i try to make
EDsed251:124	S1:	 but isn't it the same isn't it the case also today because you have those like us who have the chance to go abroad or to go abroad or or to be international or whatever and other people i don't know still stick i don't know to their village and and being i don't know postman of their village they are never never going out they're never seeing different things

EDsed251:139	S1:	 any other opinions or ideas or ge- suggestions or
EDsed251:140	S5:	 i think the cases are only the same if we reduce it to the middle age elites only they had the opportunity to go abroad and and when they came home they met elites because he because if he's the son of a duke or even a bishop a illegal son

EDsed251:142	S5:	 a illegal son he would never never talk to a farmer
EDsed251:143	SX-f:	 xx 
EDsed251:144	S5:	 hh and in and in fact tod- today's people know mo- know much more about the middle age than the people knew then in those times so hh so er the cases can't be the same hh and a- and and on the other hand if you if you consider we have a free willing er integration process in in euro- in europe hh and and that's not the process in those times
EDsed251:145	S1:	 what do you mean by that
EDsed251:146	S5:	 erm i mean it is it is nearly impossible to to do european integration by what for example today xx 
EDsed251:147	S1:	 to to force territories to integrate 
EDsed251:148	S5:	 yes to force to force to integr- to to force the integration and and that's the that's the main point of difference because because i went abroad i got my education and i used it at home for my duke for my bishop fo- for my ho- hometown and and and today i think we get educa- er we get education and we don't know where we gonna use it and that's the that's the big difference 
EDsed251:149	S1:	 mhm but let me be provocative er was it on free will for example that western european countries reintegrated after the second world war was germany asked for example

EDsed251:152	S5:	 but but at least the founding of e g k s was already free will before it the it it could it could not be free will that's that's that's that's no question

EDsed251:235	S11:	 and usually if you are one year for example abroad hh and y- you want to come come home you lose the political situation some contacts and what is happening in your country hh so the question is if you want to stay at the university when you

EDsed251:243	SX-f:	 but 
EDsed251:244	S15:	 law is different because hh every country's law er law's particular and law er er perception is different i think and maybe it's true on law 
EDsed251:245	S12:	 that's what i said that the the economics or history or architecture or whatever hh er doesn't matter where you study
EDsed251:246	S15:	 but 
EDsed251:247	S12:	 but the law is very specific i think that er hh from my xxx when i want to be international or so or international lawyer okay 
EDsed251:248	S15:	 yeah law is xx law is xx 
EDsed251:249	S12:	 i can go anywhere and er study anywhere but when i want to be a good l- l- lawyer in er in slovakia i need to study slovak also it doesn't bring really hh nothing to me to go somewhere abroad and to study 
EDsed251:250	S1:	 but do you think you can be a successful lawyer even in slovakia if you don't have 
EDsed251:251	S12:	 here 
EDsed251:252	S1:	 er knowledge of of er international business law international trade law hh what have you 
EDsed251:253	S12:	 oh pf 
EDsed251:254	S1:	 and you can also see it from another perspective i know i mean it's also it can 
EDsed251:255	S12:	 yah 
EDsed251:256	S1:	 be easily explained why law is in such a specific situation because law is the means to administer and to integrate society so i don't know er if the austrian emperors wanted to integrate x empire hh they tried to introduce a common law huh it was same case centuries before in in england that's why we have the common law system hh it exactly meant that the english kings tried to use one system not the tribal system of the scots and the wales and the er the the people in ireland hh but to introduce one common system the common law of england hh and it was the same in the era of the na- er the nation state that it was very important also to make people think even if it's not reality that it's a very specific thing hh the austrian legal system the german legal system the slovakian legal system the hungarian legal system the french legal system hh but and let me make again this bridge to the past er is it is it that different even if you look to something very specific 
EDsed251:257	SX:	
EDsed251:258	S1:	 the slovakian commercial law i'm quite sure that you i don't know fifty sixty per cent of it principles er enclosed in er slovakian commercial law hh are coming from ancient roman law
EDsed251:259	S12:	 er er 
EDsed251:260	S12:	 yes i yes i agree with you er with regards the the basi- o- or the basic or the the inter- the the international subject yeah i agree with you that i can study er m- commercial law in somewhere abroad hh that the the main the main part is the same but er er and and the general knowledge the international knowledge of it is really necessary hh but er when i thi- when when i think it er when i think it practically hh when i'm at home and i can er for example a- after the or or beside the school i can practice er beside the school er beside the school i can practice er somewhe- er somewhere in a er office in a law office hh and erm study besi- er be- er practice and study er together and er i'm i'm in contact with that law hh but when i go somewhere abroad and to study er whatever er er international law and something like that hh er erm erm i can x er in this one year when i'm abroad hh i got out of the knowledge of the slovak law and so whe- when i come home i er re- need some time to hh go into once more hh so i th- so think that er er it's better for me to stay at home and to hh er to

EDsed251:265	S12:	 it's it's a good opportunity to go somewhere abroad hh i i agree with that but er er i also can study at home er the the international principles and things like that hh and from the practical er point of view it's better to stay home and to p- and practise it and not got get out of it get out of the subject
EDsed251:266	S1:	 it also depends on on on what perspectives you see for yourself of course i mean 
EDsed251:267	S12:	 yah 
EDsed251:268	S1:	 no question i totally agree hh er there was 
EDsed251:269	S19:	 aren't we talking about european x reinte- -integration hh that means that er many international businesses and companies are coming also to slovakia france and whatever hh and when you wanna be a lawyer er it's a there is a very high er probability hh that you will be working for an international company and as we know commercial er lawyers are very good paid if we are talking j- only about the money hh and er they require you to know their law so er i don't think that it's er just a loss of time a waste of time to go abroad even when you are studying law because er it may give you different views and er different chances to let look at the law hh and all the people or all the hh er good law offices or international compli- er companies will appreciate your knowledge and it will be necessary for you as a lawyer to know the situation because we are all integrated and er i don't think that we can just like stop in- integration

EDsed251:293	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDsed251:294	S5:	 for example there should be a motorway built in [place17] they they found a team of ten to twenty lawyers i- in fact there are one hundred twenty lawyers only in [place2] hh they found a team of t- er of of ten lawyers or something like that belonging to different countries having studied different law and they worked together hh to to bring this motorway built 
EDsed251:295	SX-f:	 mhm

EDsed251:329	SX-m:	 @@@@
EDsed251:330	S3:	 first of all erm to erm to what you've been saying i think it also depends on what idea of education you have for yourselves and if you think you have this pragmatic point of view and you want to study law and stay in your country hh or if you say erm you would like to broaden your horizon go abroad regardless of what you will be learning and just to see a different cu- er culture and how the people live so that's i guess also an a d- a different idea of education what people can have hh and i also wanted to say something more general about erm the past and today and erm in the past in europe it was mainly a political process that was a political integration erm and it was only a very small percentage it was like five per cent of the population that even had the possibility to study and then of those not all of them were traveling scholars so it was a very very small percentage erm and today it's more the economy is the driving force and there are a lot more subjects and a lot more xxx up to thirty per cent up to forty per cent of an age cohort that erm have an academic erm education and so erm i think it's very different and that a whole a bigger brand a a bigger spectrum of society is is able to participate in higher education and also to participate in er international exchange
EDsed251:331	S1:	 definitely true
EDsed251:332	S3:	 hm 
EDsed251:333	S1:	 as regards percentage and and accessibility to xx integration in general i mean it's not only true for higher education at those times maybe it's those five per cents had access to education at all 
EDsed251:334	SX-f:	 mhm 
EDsed251:335	S1:	 and and all the rest had had no educ- er no school education at all hh er but i'm not so sure if it's true that er you know in the history we had you know political forces hh and today we're all driven by economics er i i think it it it's it's it depends on our picture we have from history of what we learn in school or generally about history hh because i mean for exam- just an example er emperor charles the fifth fifteen hundred erasmus of rotterdam's time erm ruling half of europe and america
EDsed251:336	S1:	 higher than in in the eighteenth nineteenth century hh of of nationalism er er er

EDsed251:544	SX-f:	 hm 
EDsed251:545	S1:	 and to make it more flexible the whole european higher education hh er system maybe we have to explain it to our colleagues er in austria we're on the way to change the whole thing according to the bologna process hh all all our studies er in a two cycle system meaning bachelor and master degree hh er it basically means that it doesn't mean a change of contents but we just you know cut somewhere after six semester say okay this is hh history er so first six semesters then you have write a bachelor paper and er you have the bachelor degree hh and then you go on but they don't really change

EDsed251:548	SX:	
EDsed251:549	S1:	 because it's easy to say okay after six semesters okay you get your bachelor degree hh without changing any contents for example huh er but the main idea so far within the framework of the european higher educa- higher education area 
EDsed251:550	S5:	 hm 
EDsed251:551	S1:	 is to make the make it possible to change i- in within degree programs and after degree programs and i i don't see the link between even in law a two-cycle system and labor market because it's up to the labor market hh if the if the l- if the lawyers' chamber decided we only take er master students as lawyers you have to go on with your master yah
EDsed251:552	S5:	 it has er er it will it will decide xx

EDsed251:576	S7:	 at the same point so 
EDsed251:577	S1:	 that's why within the bologna system the common european qualification framework is ins- introduced and hh if you come as a slova- slovakian student to an austrian university and hh and saying or applying for being accepted as a master student hh that they have
