PBpan28:2	S2:	 thank you thank you thank you [S1] er just a few words about about russian market so far er russian has been famous only by er oil and gas national monopolies and a few prominent ecological parts and er these er corporates have been taking quite cheap resources from from the world and er hh basically the margins are narrowing in russia and er russian banks have to find er another interesting possibilities er to this topic er is covering er pension reform and mortgage er er business small businesses er they are not so developed in russia unfortunately er banks have to rely only on er short-term resources and er they have to find some other niches er for approximately two years ago er certain players have erm discovered for them while these were interesting markets er which was er consumal ending and er we can remember just good use er which has er which happened er this er last summer er to foreign banks being departed by g capital they acquired russian banks and they they demonstrated really er first national interest of er foreign investors foreign banks er in er in this year and er now what we're expecting is the boom is the er boom er on s m e markets and er really er er there so er few players on this market now er our bank is one of the top players with hundred million dollars of portfolio on s m e loans er but er we find er that's er really er not so many players only maybe one one or two state owned banks by national bank and a couple of er foreign banks are interested in this market i mean this markets and er we feel that this er area can represent er quite substantial interest er both for er russian russian banks and foreign banks and er well er we feel that er the margins er are hi- are quite high on this markets and that though er we we are prepared to xx higher higher provision and this loans er still er we feel that er er this er this this market that has er quite interesting perspect if we compare er just er s m e niche in russia which is maybe ten per cent of the g d p er the employees this means with what we have in europe approximately fifty sixty per cent as of economics taken we can understand that this er area can be developed very fast and er we're expecting more players to come to to to the markets assimilate loans and er basically er that will also give banks er more more liquidity and er er er yesterday during the er er presentation of er of our our colleagues from kazakhstan er the main topic was er market share the market share and er for er russia it's quite difficult er because we have er dominant player which is [org6] which holds more than sixty per cent of the markets currently both in retail and er corporal business and therefore the banks can cut only up to er one per cent of the market two per cent and that's already quite er bold bol- bold and er er we feel that er er more interest from foreign investors would appear when er er certain players on the markets will have more than two per cent of the market share er in er in in retail market and s m e market and er we're expecting that next year maybe er two thousand six there'll be some some new yields on the market some new foreign banks coming er and er hopefully that will bring to the russian long- to the russian long-term resources which will be able to which will er help russia to also to have er better access to the erm well to the i- to the issues we're discussing today the mortgages and er to the to the er investment banking possibilities
PBpan28:3	S1:	 of course er talking about the russian financial markets we can spend the entire session er on that and er let me hand over to er [S3] [S3/last] and introduce a little bit of the polish market as well and please just join us in in the discussion and ask questions to er individual segments of the markets you are interested in and er really join us this is erm this is not supposed to be an introduction and s- it is not supposed to be a presentation of our individual views it er it's supposed to be really a discussion and er please really join us any time you feel so thank you er [S3] [S3] 
PBpan28:4	S3:	 so good morning i would like to correct one things about my person so i'm i was i'm a former vice-chairman of the commission so i am now by management board of central deposity of securities it's in fact i hope that i'm still able to answer some questions about the regulatory matters @@ er it's it is a very difficult job to say in very short time about er the market so i will not say that we have stock exchange and i will not say that we have refugee and some things which are belonging to the modern world so i will concentrate myself on the main problems and the on re- rec- recent developments of the polish market and i will say some word few words about the pension reform in my country er so in my probably not only my in from the point of your statistics er we are one of the most successful markets not only in the central eastern europe but in the europe at all bec- why er because er in the last ye- year in the two hundred four we had er we had two er thirty-six new issues er er of the stocks on the market more more new er public of the world were only in london xxx er it was connected with the one of the biggest privatization in poland because er the biggest retail bank which is [org7] that was privatized it it was very big success from the point of your state treasury in poland that we received huge er money from the privatization er and from the point of view of the let's say society because there were many new investors who they win probably still by the capital market in poland 
PBpan28:5	S1:	 [S3] tell us actually why do you think that that we felt two er representatives from poland here why poland is really different from the other central and eastern european markets sort of poles are bigger players er the 
PBpan28:6	S3:	 mhm 
PBpan28:7	S3:	 yeah i i i think 
PBpan28:8	S1:	 because people like to play xxx and er invest their money
PBpan28:9	S3:	 i think there are three main parquets the first one is of course our accession to european union in my provided for which is er which increased the attrac- attractiveness of our market for the er for the investor the foreign investors now we have about thirty-six per cent in terms of our market are foreign investors about thirty er per cent are er is traditional polish investors and the rest are xxx investors the second factor the second factor is privatization because er of the is probably the last year was the first year after the five years er break period er when the site stated arised the plan of privatization er there was about ninety nineteen billions er of revenues from the privatization and there are plans for the future which are very attractive for er potential investors er knowing the character of my country when i think that the privatization of the vodka producers will be very attractive 
PBpan28:10	SX-m:	 @@
PBpan28:11	S3:	 but seriously speaking i think that if it will er be successful product of the privatization of the er the bigger polish insurance company if it will be er success er because of the same problems on this way er so this is with the second part the privatization and the third part always which important from the point of view of the topics of the discussion is pension funds our pension er funds er regulation is five years old and now we have fifteen er pension funds this number was decreased because on the beginning it was twenty-one it was decreased not because of the bankruptcy but because of the mergers and and and changes in the structure and so why is this er po- pension funds product so important for the market because it's a mandatory it's a mandatory for the citizens and it's about eleven er millions er of citizens er probably twelve millions in the in this year which are mandatory in cash er in this er plan and there is about er there is a about four f- forty mill- billions of euro in cash er in er er pension funds which is er comparable with about ten billions euros in in investment er funds and pension funds are the big are big players on the polish market because they have about twenty per cent er er of the equities er market and last but not least er they have a very strong limitation and they because they cannot invest more than five per cent in the foreign er in the foreign er securities as a result of this regulation 
PBpan28:12	SX-1:	 yeah 
PBpan28:13	S3:	 they have to er they they are s- they have to s- be present on the polish market and er increase their liquidity and er demand
PBpan28:14	SX-1:	 all right 
PBpan28:15	S3:	 because it is in the modern er our market it's more the problem of dem- of demand not the supply and maybe the last actor of which is maybe not very important from the economical point of view but it's a a reason that i i did a crowd @ to got off my mind that we we we we had in last year some er double listings projects that that that the fir- that was the first er offer which was er double listing er on the base of the european union er regulation which is a german company [org23] and er there are some companies which are er listed both in in warsaw and in budapest er the probably the most important is the biggest hungarian oil company [org8] which is this the size two three or three months on the warsaw stock exchange and there's there was a s- american company which is listed er er on nasdaq which is a pharmaceut pharmacy company er and it's listed since one months er in warsaw so it's xxxx of us yeah 
PBpan28:16	S1:	 we can clearly see that er the polish market is sort of a blue-chip among the central and eastern european markets it's a it's highly 
PBpan28:17	S3:	 uhu it's stranded 
PBpan28:18	S1:	 yeah it's highly liquid there is interest in domestic and international international investors as well er if we sort of jump from central europe to er er to asia erm what is the situation in erm in kazakhstan how is er how the market looks there
PBpan28:19	S4:	 good morning ladies and gentlemen erm er [first name1] [last name1] said that russia is famous in oil gas kazakhstan is famous in oil and gas
PBpan28:20	SX-1:	 @@@
PBpan28:21	S4:	 but also the strong financial institutions for example in the banking sector and pension pension sector i hope that's the er legal volume on the pension and mortgage er still xx in kazakhstan er that's today xxxx er we think is very successful we have er right now around fifteen pension funds with asset size around three point two billion dollars which is one of our major investment in total er er we know that besides xx bank banks are profitle banks we are er er participating fix intern er market between bonds and pension funds happily taken and for the as we face the pension funds face a little bit of a problem a lack of sec- er instruments er and er as you know er in kazakhstan the problem is for pension funds is a negative er yielding er it's the xx second year that's because er we think that erm good erm historical is high prizes for er export goods like oil gas metals xx and government er doesn't need pension money but however still pension funds need to invest in the er securities which er issued by government and er er and this securities are not enough in er real income in terms for pension funds and there is a restriction also to buy the corporate bonds and er as er for example in polish pension funds cannot buy korean papers or it should be they can buy and there is a a limit er to ten per cent but however it should be not er rated less than er a rating and therefore you can see that er it will present again less in- er er less than inflation interest rate in kazakhstan that's why they are coming so er i mean in real incomes they are not good with x however er we think that er our government are preparing and it was said in er last er finance financial er meetings in kazakhstan in [place5] er we should er provide more instruments for pension funds with er s- er make loans in privatization er we actually right now have a securitization like er mortgage-backed securities which is er very common for commercial banks and a put it to a market on pension funds buy it and and er it would be very good product for example for to securitize some er cash flow for example securitizing some cash flow of er big companies hh where er pension funds can buy er this securities project finance er project er bonds for example which will be er guaranteed by the government that pension funds can buy one that's how they can improve their er er er real income er ratio and this er problems is faced er for pension funds is let's say it's if we had er four five years of liquidity problems now for pension funds is i guess to place with liquidity in the market that's er how it goes in pension funds 
PBpan28:22	S1:	 are there any er liquid stocks in kazakhstan like er like in poland er what could be there to be of the interest of the national investors or 
PBpan28:23	S4:	 hh er 
PBpan28:24	S1:	 what the locals buy 
PBpan28:25	S4:	 the stock market it's er as many er er hear er maybe it's more dead than alive hh because er i think for example er it's because of ca- corporate culture er companies are not ready to open their financials and to attract er er all the big companies because er or right now that that's big companies they don't need this money 
PBpan28:26	SX-m:	 no 
PBpan28:27	S4:	 cos they're gaining from the high export er prices and maybe at the next stage that will be the stage where they will go to the stock market and make funds and but for right now there is no 
PBpan28:28	S1:	 any any intention of the government to put some of the state-owned companies onto the market
PBpan28:29	S4:	 yeah they are planning to open er er that's what announce to open er some agency where there will be all the blue-chips companies and at least twenty-five per cent of the state will be er listed on list a that's upper level of our stock exchange listing and then the investors can buy it which will be er floated not only in er initially but on a secondary market also which is a problem right now in kazakhstan for stock market we think that the next stage with kazakhstan the stock market should er grow er rapidly 
PBpan28:30	S1:	 mhm 
PBpan28:31	S4:	 that's the way that i i try to define it easily and more cheaply 
PBpan28:32	S1:	 mhm yeah mister er [S5/last] what about serbia serbia is geographically in between poland and and er and er kazakhstan of course closer to poland is er the market closer to poland as well or is it closer to er kazakhstan
PBpan28:33	S5:	 okay i will tell you firstly that er you know that at the end of the eighties the ex-yugoslavia was really the more developed east european country but we had a problems in civil war there and er especially serbia started real reforms just four years ago it's very short period i cannot tell that we are satisfied in the stage but yah we know that we have this kind of progress which we made in past four years i will concentrate on some existing figures and the structuring of the financial sector especially as er privatization of banking sector because i think er it's er important pot- potential investors know more about that because er in this year we'll have er five tendants with five banks in which state had a joint degree ah example in er two thousand we had inflation hundred thirty per cents a year in two thousand er four it was seven point eight per cent in two thousand three seven point eight in two thousand four a little bit higher thirty per cent thirty point five per cents er foreign currency reserves in two thousand was only zero point five billion euros er dollars now is almost five billion dollars it's not still strong figure but it can show the progress this for deficit in two thousand four it's only two point five of g d p in two thousand five bit that one point five per cent it's real growth g d p is almost eighty per cent in er two thousand four we xx x xxx from the first january this year now we are checking the results of that er we made a agreement with [org24] three years agreement we have a very good corporation with xxx xx and er we have a fifty plus x rating of xxx and before that in november two thousand and four it's some kind of the you know the our proposition what i can tell about liquidity we are not satisfied what is the reason maybe because in two thousand we closed twenty-five domestic banks because we had er artificial assets in that banks maybe we had strong reforms result was that we xxx x x eleven banks we really had strong xxx without that eleven banks and it's a pretty big trade with that amount in the market we are having this incr- increase of er ratabilities it was for the eleven months from the december last year november this year it's forty-five per cent and that was an increase in eighty per cent er we are not satisfied with the structure of the xx xxx x because they have er more er than thirty per cent er er progress in the retail sector we like to again invest you know in a more xx economy and companies and er it's the reason that we as a revoltary institution established that specific rules we don't to compete example er investment in er cit- but citizens more than sub- seven per cent as in croatian example but er we er we put some new measures example that er er for the xx citizens for a period er er the period of five years it's necessary to have deposit x xxx x x thirty per cent if er we don't have that it will be only category for reservation and er er that actually may be more expensive what is about privatization of the banking sector i think it's er er maybe most important thing in the moment er that we are just finishing the deal of [org9] the biggest er er serbian bank and er in er march in public er to the public standards but two two banks one [org10] and [org11] i will just mention the names of the banks that showed interest [org12] [org13] as a fund [org14] [org15] [org16] you know and er we are very glad that er er we can that interest on that respectable foreign players it's also interesting that er one domestic bank er in which erm er er it had been anticipation that they sold that bank and er a very good price to compete er it's er a ratio between the book value and the price it think it's very good it's show that er our market er at least its huge potential and er the investor xx in our market and er we are expecting in this year next er five tenders what is important for us that we are also in banking distribution we are more more concentrated xx on a xx based supervision than on client-based supervision what is the reason that we really want to establish the er real procedure in the banks that er we should be sure that er our companies and that is that carry that with the money and er that with the banks and er i can tell that we are very strict and er we're now implement some very strong measure to some banks in xx banks er one month er xx but er as er our minister of finance said yesterday what is the most important piece for for us are structural reforms structural res- we have structural reforms in the public sector i think is the most important things it will also have a a influence on liquidity in the market and on other things
PBpan28:34	S1:	 you you er mister [S5/last] you you er talked a lot about the the banking sector and the privatization of the banking sector we have on our panel the the most experienced banker i would say er mister [S6/last] er mister [S6/last] er we talk about the the markets in in poland and the attractiveness of the markets er being that capital markets being liquidity capital markets for the domestic and international investors er what about the local banks what about your clients what er what erm er what is the attraction of the local market for you for your clients
PBpan28:35	S6:	 er thank you er ladies and gentlemen i am a born optimist and i'm very xx on poland so you are going to hear a side that will be very very optimistic and this is exactly how i feel about the subject i'm er first i think i would say that er we have to er spend a minute on a historical aspect and that is er it is true that the financial services sector was the er first time to really be a a restructure in poland and and because of that er the banking system and the banking sector erm has had er many many successes erm the presenter when they talk about the capital allocation erm er in poland er some people er tend to say that it's very much mature and very similar to to what we're have out of poland a- and if we compare for example our situation today with the situation of er er spain just two years ago and er we can see that er twenty per cent and er of investment are in securities reform and that versus er forty fifty per cent of us in in er in spain at that time so it seem that really things are moving er very fast in poland and er erm here the only issue that we do have is that the monetary er policies and changes erm er were not the same er they were in fact actually successful unfortunately they were not hold up by the fiscal policies and changes and this is where we have this er this harmony i- in poland i believe that this is now being er fixed and and that the situation will be much better so as soon as we really pay more attention to the fiscal policies and the placing of the er budget deficits and xing costs that we're were really talking about we'll see that the er atmosphere's gonna be different and that the clients are really going to take more advantage of what's available er er in the market polish banking sector is very strong it went through many changes from the very beginning er years and years ago there are different stages of of the reforms i will not go through that but i think they're extremely stable we never had any kind of crisis in this involvement erm and and er er the the privatization took place erm there was a slowdown er for a while but now w- we solved this really particularly thing er it it really er happened er very successfully and at the same time everybody sees that the er warsaw stock exchange er it became a really important platform for all the investors er to really er problematization a very transparent way er a very very solid way of going through the er the changes so i think we're going to see more of that that means that the climate is better the customers the clients have more trust in the system regardless of what's happening politically in poland i think that really poles are more immune and the investors within poland and outside of poland are more immune to these things and there i really believe that the economic reform is a very some strong er economy stock exchange the fact that we have [org17] by the way it was the first one to give er debut as a foreign company the fi- on the warsaw stock exchange now i believe we have already the four companies i think xx 
PBpan28:36	S3:	 [org18] american company and xxxx x 
PBpan28:37	S6:	 perfect i think that that it is it is very strong stock exchange and xxxx in the west
PBpan28:38	S3:	 ah five and er american company 
PBpan28:39	S6:	 xx 
PBpan28:40	S6:	 mhm and and i think that the the er present decapitalization is in the level i think fifty fifty billion euro er some say that it's even more than that and that the value of the warsaw stock exchange actually sees a hundred er billion euro so i think er really xxx go-go as it
PBpan28:41	S1:	 okay thank you er we talked about the markets we talk about the financial institution banks er er that leads me er to a question to er [S7] [S7/last] as er er he really covers the whole region of course er analyzing the banks in central and eastern europe erm what will you tell xx about the banks about the the the the region what would be your factive on that 
PBpan28:42	S7:	 okay i thank you [S1] and good morning everyone hh erm yeah we we've seen a lot of progress in the er the banking systems of er central and eastern europe er over the last five years erm i think a lot of it has to come down to sort of a lowering in reforms that we made erm er improvements in the economies of the coun- the countries and what the the foreign direct investors brought to er to these countries and to the to the banks erm they provided a lot of er expertise particularly in mismanagement er products services technology et cetera and it is it's really helping to er t- to to push more er to develop it within the er the banking systems and okay er let's see and er where i talked a little bit about the re- retail sector er we're seeing a lot of er progress there in particular erm it's is banks move away very much fr- from the large corporates where the margins are very thin now and looking more at the sort of retail markets the s u vs et cetera and you if you move even further you look at sort of erm what we are doing into the massive management and things like that as well and er again er trying to er to sort of promote to the different types of savings within the er countries and a- again in poland we've we we've seen this erm that's er there're there y- y- a lot of sort of investment funds that are are are being grown there and the locals there are being improved hh erm i mean i i could draw on all day talking about the banking systems in in in the countries it's of in the region but i think that's you were going back to the subject of of of liquidity of the the financial er markets here being the region erm i think it is great to see sort of the improvement in liquidity in in in poland and i think that's somewhat you know kno- in in fact that it's not a so much of a supply problem and that's and er i i would say this what you see recently parti- particularly with the er the privatization of [org19] you know into the market and and not through a er foreign directed investor it's not in developed markets as well hh i think erm overall there has been erm a a real lack of investible assets er for for local investors in particular erm in in the recent years and i think think that's the the way that a lot of companies make blue-chips the the large banks get privatized has sort of taken some assets away from the market er and we see sort of xx xx as well as a number of er companies coming back on the market but i think that was also a a a major issue in the past and also sort of crowding up of the the public finances for the erm the capital markets but i think going forward what we really need to see in a lot of these coun- these countries is improvements in in erm in in pension fund legislation in erm sort of the the corporate governance issues er accounting issues et cetera and i think that's you know i- investors m- particularly private investors really need to feel protected er when they buy into in different assets and i think that's erm hh you know a a a lot of progress still has to be made in in in in those areas
PBpan28:43	S1:	 you're talking a lot and and you're the expert really about the the the banking sector and er we touched many times on er bank [org6] and i have to probably say that we need mentioning the equitiation of the the bank [org19] er which was er two point four billion euro in the end erm er you can teach on the differences in er privatizations er erm er in the region in the individual countries the the approach of poland er is the market approach i would say most of the companies and of course the last example of the er [org19] is the listing of er er the stocks on er the local stock exchange hh it's a the erm afforge to supply new stocks to to the market erm er is po- is poland to you more an exception or is is that trend somehow er developing across across the region
PBpan28:44	S7:	 erm for the moment i i would say sort of poland is is more of an exception now i i i think it's it's also been a way to the privatizations in in xx in the past across the region er but i mean i i think that's there is probably a a a bit sort of xx up the market for for the companies wanting to raise capital across the region and and i think that's yeah there is a a a a also the cost of raising the capital raising it all at the stock exchanges having sorting themselves out to er greatest xxx erm transformity et cetera on the other hand that the you know the banks have been very instrumental in providing er funds to corporates in the past and that's sort of you know margins you see by the margins ingredient particularly for the blue-chips and allow chips for huge size companies yeah and those margins have been really squeezed and and and that's been sort of you know in some ways cheaper for for for the corporates to raise money through to 
PBpan28:45	S1:	 hm 
PBpan28:46	S7:	 banks rather than the the capital markets 
PBpan28:47	S1:	 hm mhm erm it seems like we talked about in the end we talked about er er lot about liquidity in the markets and the supply of er er the stocks to the markets and er of course then er er way about the acts of the capital markets rather than about er the rest of the of the financial markets erm yeah er what i what i would like to er touch on er is there anything the er regulators the watchdogs the european union erm anything they can jointly or individually do for improving the markets improving the liquidity transparency er and et cetera et cetera
PBpan28:48	S7:	 no we we we touched on first of all about the financial service of action plan the the european union is is trying to base- i mean basically to introduce a a a a simple integrated market for financial services across the e u and i think you know with extremely the the financial service of action plan it would be able to do a lot of these things or or or or progressing with this particularly through sort of erm you know er accounting xx changes through the sort of mandatory use of er use of erm international financial serv- er fi- international financial accounting practices erm which will make erm you know our companies much more transparent er you know already xx of corporate governments and it would make sort of you know a a much more sort of level playing field and comparability across the region erm and it's also there to to help sort of erm build the er reg- er re- regulatory regulatory er environment erm and in fact capital markets here as well so you know there is sort of a a move to increase comparability transparency and erm help to improve the the capital markets and such 
PBpan28:49	S1:	 this x terms of the accession countries and er and e u what about what about russia and kazakhstan er is is is there something er is there a message er to the the local s c c the the the the loc- the local regulatory bodies that would er er influence the the markets the liquidity of the markets or are those institutions in kazakhstan and russia working er efficiently enough
PBpan28:50	S2:	 er yes i think that yes central bank of russian federation has to pull er european rules and er er starting er from last year er the system of erm er insurance of private customer xx had been established and er er from october the banks er one by one they were fostered for this system and er er we become the member of the system in october and i would say that really we spend a lot of time with central bank er they they have been using really er european standards and assessing the er adequacy of the capital erm er the er er internal controls er and er all other issues er which are the same in europe as in russian and er erm also er you see er these er since the er third er fourth quarter of two thousand four all russian banks have to provide accounts in accordance with international economic standards which was also painful for some regional banks especially with er er which never had access to the international funds er but er still they have to compa- to compa- er comply with these er rules and er er well er russian banks er would also follow these general trends in terms of er this er general rules established by by across the e u er as well as the er basel erm xx ratios okay thank you
PBpan28:51	S1:	 er before i go to er [S4] [S4/last] er any any comment any remarks er from from the audience any questions no [S4] yeah okay sure sure sure yes yeah yeah 
PBpan28:52	S6:	 erm i think you mentioned the corporate governance issue and and er we hadn't spent enough time but i think this is a truly important that er everybody is aware of that er that as as as far as poland is concerned erm i think there's a tremendous improvement made er er as far as corporate governance the the erm this erm has been accepted er by the erm er regulators this is now being enforced and as far as the banking system is concerned as far as the warsaw stock exchange and i think that that gives tremendous transparency to the investors and i was spending a lot of time er outside of poland working with investors i already found out that they really appreciated because that gives them the this comfort that they do know what's really happening and again i like to have to say that in poland we were er i think erm er very like and they are very very strong er monitoring system implemented on the very beginning and to a great er pleasure while we xxxxx as the market becomes more mature actually also the regulators have changed their approach and they became more mature in that sense as well more flexible xx xxx xx xxx 
PBpan28:53	S3:	 actually there's that er there's regulation of the warsaw stock exchange that each different company should er accept the corporate governance code just not in the sense er that e- she as the company should accept the whole of that the reign er because of ukraine their rule complain of extent in the case in the company not accept any of those rules this company is obliged to say why 
PBpan28:54	SX-5:	 xx xx xx 
PBpan28:55	S1:	 yes please start 
PBpan28:56	S5:	 i'm not talking about the xxxx that these x x xx 
PBpan28:57	S1:	 @@@@@ hh @ hh part of it @@@
PBpan28:58	S5:	 yeah 
PBpan28:59	S5:	 @@ well there is a regulation i think the second phase is a bit of interest policy really how we can teach the clients in the market for example we as national bank of [place4] we're that way an example o- we have problem about the the interest rates you know especially about capital passive and active interest rate you know the difficulties that especially about the fees also you know
PBpan28:60	SX-f:	 i know 
PBpan28:61	S5:	 and er we are you know publishing's er you know that kind of the the fees of different banks the interest rate we introduced the packet interest rate in the first february you know to explain the people what are the really interest rate what are the other expenses and that kind of things i think one thing with the regulatory way it's er it's okay but secondly it can be also transparency and also it can push that maybe to do something else
PBpan28:62	S1:	 understood is there enough transparency in kazakhstan
PBpan28:63	S4:	 there there is erm against russia said that they just established for example insurance of er the publics we already did it three or four years ago and er we are now er established erm er insurance erm er er for mortgages er it's a er actually our xx xx if you do it for er er improving our mortgage er mort- within the country for example and er f- for s- companies who wants to join stock exchange need er to have er accounting standards european accounting standards our banks already er transformed this period two years ago so that's already established that and the s- the second stage is now er to put er push more transparency xx before stock market cos er i see er stock market should be one of the er place where the er money should flow for investors to envisage need this er investments and the transparency of that is most er important 
PBpan28:64	S1:	 hm hm the market er participants are international and er and local investors er we talk about the er attractiveness of the local markets is there any attraction of the regional markets to you to to the banks in russia in in in poland do you invest in or do you actively participate in other financial markets in the region
PBpan28:65	S6:	 erm we do not you know it was a power group the [org20] group is that er er each entity erm works er in some environment so [org21] does not invest outside of poland
PBpan28:66	S1:	 are there any and we touch on it xxxxx are there any restriction for the polish investors for the individuals to er er invest abroad in erm like outside e u or in other countries
PBpan28:67	S3:	 er my er my xx there are er no legal restriction for investors there are some restriction i said will be for for pension funds but that is an exception but this is not a problem of the legal restriction i think that the first er er local market is relatively attractive for er investor the second are the costs of er grant the the foreign markets er are too high it's relatively possible there are some brokeage house where they er give such possibility but it's too expensive and hh er if you have i- if you if you are going to invest in debt securities in fact er the polish debt securities domes- er securities are they have relatively high rate comparable with other in european er debts er governmental deb- debt securities so it's possible that 
PBpan28:68	S1:	 make no sense to the economic exchange rate raised and et cetera et cetera 
PBpan28:69	S3:	 mhm 
PBpan28:70	S1:	 what about to to your bank er [S2] er do you participate abroad do you er 
PBpan28:71	S2:	 er well you see er i think er our main er target market is still russia er yesterday there was also discussions with er of of our colleagues from kazakhstan and that's er we have only thirty-five banks or thirty-six banks if i'm not mistaken and er there's no major consolidation er well in russia this year we expect that er instead of thirty hundred banks push beh- probably have in russia some of them are really not banks small companies er all well quite substantial majority will er go out of the market because they will not be er licensed by the central bank to continue operations with the er private customers but mainly that will be small banks and regional banks and we feel that er some of them are really quite interesting because er they have er a good regional franchise and er they could be quite er interesting partners er but er still russia remains our main main markets
PBpan28:72	S1:	 er we we concentrated a lot on the equity capital market rather than on the debt capital markets erm er erm i actually start with with poland again erm and er and you actually [S3] you just now mentioned the the market of the government bonds
PBpan28:73	S3:	 yes er 
PBpan28:74	S1:	 er xxx what about the what about the corporate what about the corporate bonds market 
PBpan28:75	S3:	 yes 
PBpan28:76	S3:	 yeah 
PBpan28:77	S3:	 yeah er the same way as mister [S6/last] i am very optimistic about polish market er maybe cos this is the reason why i didn't catch the problem of debt securities because er in our opinion there is a big domination of state treasury securities er and i don't know exactly the numbers but i remember from there were something said this is about two or three per cent of the volume er which is which are corporate and municipal er bonds so i think there are plan maybe that maybe this er the role of er municipal and corporate bonds will increase because of er two reasons the first reason is that the interest rate of er state treas- treasury wants to be decreased and there is a process of changing er relatively short- er -term erm state secu- securities into er lo- long- sh- -term or mid-long- 
PBpan28:78	S1:	 mhm 
PBpan28:79	S3:	 -term but because of this pro- this probably we are o- er investors er our issues the corp- corporate issue issue is to ensure er securities and success erm 
PBpan28:80	S1:	 what about the what about the corporate corporate bonds market er is it sufficiently 
PBpan28:81	S3:	 but this is only minor 
PBpan28:82	S3:	 no no for sure 
PBpan28:83	S1:	 formed 
PBpan28:84	S3:	 er in the last years er corporate er issue has has not able to er to fight successful with the state treasurer and with the state treasure int- in- into interest rate and this is the main reason why this sector of the market is underdevel- -developed
PBpan28:85	S1:	 yes hh mister [S6/last] do you rather lend money er er in a form of a loans to the clients or you er need manage the bond issues as well
PBpan28:86	S6:	 er predominantly i would say it is for for lending erm and y- you know in poland the lending to a corporate actually the growth is negative 
PBpan28:87	S1:	 mhm 
PBpan28:88	S6:	 about four per cent negative it's been a decrease a very positive growth of er the whole bank seventeen per cent thirteen per cent for the corporate erm so er some banks er actually erm either chose a different direction they were forced to be er erm a little bit er we do the encouraging er through lending predominantly but not only this the other part is roaming 
PBpan28:89	S1:	 hm 
PBpan28:90	S6:	 and i think that now that er the economy is a little bit depressed er the macroeconomics is in favor i think we're going to see more of the the structure of the market is different okay the market is much stronger there is this confidence really more important even than the money itself is the confidence of investors and because of that er and because of the macroeconomics also er monetary policy the the interest rate the inflation those things are very well-managed and i think we will be seeing more of that
PBpan28:91	S1:	 thank thank you [S7] actually one question to you er we have recently seen quite a few bond issuance euro bonds from the banks in the region actually especially from kazakhstan the the the the banks in kazakhstan are very active
PBpan28:92	S7:	 yeah 
PBpan28:93	S1:	 er is that a trend i- i- in in your view
PBpan28:94	S7:	 hh erm not so much across erm central europe the banks in the central europe are largely er er are very liquid with funds particularly from from retail depositors erm and this is on on the other hand it is sort of sort of more of a a lack of demand for for lending more than anything else so this is a lot of liquidity imposed on the market er just like kazakhstan and some o- as well as as as russia there isn't sort of the erm i'd say the erm the the the retail deposit base there er we're rea- we're rea- we're really wanting to to to help fund the banks cos yet there isn't the sort of let's say the er the comfort in the banking system and security erm in the placement of funds but er 
PBpan28:95	S1:	 is it the case in er kazakhstan [S4] er why er the local banks why they don't issue the bonds domestically there is not enough er liquidity to place the bond
PBpan28:96	S4:	 maybe you should directly pull it because er that's that's i guess i rather new issue domestical a bit critically er over pension funds is not er i mean the pension funds cannot invest as much as you want on the local point that's why is it more important to we act in the capital market of course 
PBpan28:97	S1:	 mhm 
PBpan28:98	S4:	 maybe in poland it was a demand for lending this very high specialist for consumer lending and xx little bit xxx and that can solve it in the future for kazakh- x cos big corporate already er lending er i mean erm er taking financing er abroad er themself xxx banks 
PBpan28:99	S1:	 hm 
PBpan28:100	S4:	 the banking taking confidence and that's the case in kazakhstan
PBpan28:101	S1:	 i've been actually informed that er we are running late and er if any ques- any question from the auditorium please here 
PBpan28:102	S8:	 er i didn't xx a question but a comment er on [org22] erm private company [org22] capital formations hh i've been working in the polish market for fourteen years now and i would like to share the optimism of my colleagues there mister [S6/last] and mister [S3/last] 
PBpan28:103	S1:	 mhm 
PBpan28:104	S8:	 about the further development of the polish capital markets hh but specifically i think the comment that it said this and perhaps here is the further possibilities for development of the so far relatively undeveloped part of the capital market which is debt securities er both on the corporate side and er other possibilities that are developing okay and what i see in the next three years you know the to be a major major development in two areas first of all municipal financing
PBpan28:105	SX-f:	 mhm 
PBpan28:106	S8:	 municipal bond market which is something that never existed in poland hh is just coming to be- to become a factor er the legislation for bonds is very erm er supportive but has never been used because there is an access liquidity in some other places large banks are liquid corporations are liquid and so far it has been cheaper for corporations to fund themselves by equity and by debt so there is a question of you know where where the banks go with their assets er so two things municipalities will have to fund themselves there is a number of large projects the current c- er legal structure and political structure hh of polish municipalities er is geared towards support and yourself support and therefore they will have to fund themselves in those projects er secondly they also will be receiving additional funding in the form of subsidies or refund subsidies from the e u so there is a great motivation for the initial funding to start for the project to be funded and then later with the e u money to cover them so there is going to be a lot of er i think er innovation in the way that the municipalities are going to fund themself and last but not least so far also one area that wasn't mentioned here is mortgage er market the polish mortgage market is fairly large and very robust er we have about what eight billion dollars right now of outstanding residential mortgages not withstanding some sort of legal problems or regulatory problems with er asset transfers et cetera er we do see a tremendous possibility for asset liquification over the next few years as far as mortgages are concerned er temporarily there is a hope because er the banks who have largest mortgage portfolio are the four largest banks hold about eighty per cent of the market are themselves still too liquid to actually look at it as an out- er you know er outcome for er for the liquid- liquidity problems but they are going to have ma- er asset asset liability management problems which need to be addressed and that will be the driving force for asset er asset xation and mortgage-backed securitization over the next two years and thanks to the effort of er [S3] [S3/last] and er some of pioneers in the market we have passed a securitization law in poland last year and that law is yet to be bearing fruits in form of actual securities so that's what we're looking forward to
