            <note xml:id="PRpan585_tn_0">This panel discussion is on future strategies for the prevention of refractory seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy. There are four presenters (S3, S5, S8, and S12), one chairperson (S1) and altogether six members of the audience who actively participate in the discussion. The atmosphere is rather restrained. The discussion is not very lively and the chairperson (S1) encourages the audience to ask questions. Many medical terms are used in the presentations and in the ensuing questions and answers. Therefore the number of pvcs in this transcript is especially high. </note>

<pause/><voice:pvc> pharmacoresistancy </voice:pvc> and temporal epilepsy of course is one of the major problems in <pause/> the treatment of this type of epilepsy <pause/> because patients with <pause/> from resistant temporal lobe epilepsy and other types of epilepsy of course <pause/> have an increase in <voice:pvc> psychosocial </voice:pvc> and physical immobility <pause/> and so mortality is greatly increased <pause/> erm <supplied reason="unintelligible"> xx </supplied> that of the general population<c function="fall" type="intonation"/><pause/> unfortunately only a small

approaches <pause/> erm for <pause/><voice:pvc> pharmacoresistant </voice:pvc><pause/> temporal lobe epilepsy and of course also other types <pause/> of epilepsy <pause/> so we heard in the main <emph> session </emph> on <voice:pvc> refractoriness </voice:pvc> this morning that there are <pause/> different scenarios for <pause/><voice:pvc> pharmacoresistancy </voice:pvc><pause/> and er i showed part of the slide this morning <pause/> erm so <pause/> there are at least <emph> two </emph> one is that patients are <pause/> predetermined to become refractory at the time of their first seizure and <pause/> probably the only explanation for that <pause/> is that there must be <pause/> erm a a <pause/> certain <pause/> genome in these patients explaining why they do not respond <pause/> to treatment whereas other patients with <pause/> -th apparently <voice:track medium="1" num="12" type="md"/> at least the same type <pause/> of epilepsy <emph> do </emph> respond <pause/> so the only explanation for that on my mind <pause/> is genome di- <pause/> diversity <pause/> but there is a second population of patients <pause/> erm who initially respond to treatment <pause/> but then they progress to a refractory state of a time and this can take take several years <pause/> erm and <pause/> there are several explanations for that but one very naive explanation is that <pause/> the disease progressive progress er shows progression under the treatment <pause/> so most likely both scenarios exist and there are certainly <pause/> many other scenarios <pause/> hh erm if <voice:pvc> refractoriness </voice:pvc> is <emph> not </emph> predetermined in a given patient <pause/> it might be prevented by aggressive therapy at an early stage<c function="rise"

<emph> my </emph> knowledge we do not yet <emph> have </emph> such <voice:pvc> anti-epileptic </voice:pvc> drugs which are really <pause/> disease-modifying <pause/> so once again in general <pause/>

on one model which is a lithium-<voice:pvc>pilocarpine </voice:pvc> model of epilepsy <pause/> er which has a temporal sequence which is close to<c type="lengthening"/> that encounter the human
