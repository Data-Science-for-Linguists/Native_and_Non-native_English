EDwsd304:427	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:428	S12:	 or english as language at all and hh what i developed developed was erm that in that the choice was made especially on economic reasons and that everything was following so the trend of america coming up to europe hh the u s politically there is one unity so you have no more diversity at all there is one way of thinking one language hh and in science and technology the same so all all countries having productions which which are dominating in english countries or in american countries are dominating hh other countries could be from the east from the south and wherever hh 
EDwsd304:429	SX-1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:430	S12:	 and that the whole movement is coming but really radically or for x economic reasons to one unity which could be hh either e- europe or hh or may america and europe together or just stays one block which is s- er strength politically 
EDwsd304:431	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:432	S12:	 economically technologically erm and language there is no more language than english in that part 
EDwsd304:433	S1:	 okay

EDwsd304:435	S3:	 okay trying to catch er your what you're saying in in in one or two words is could could you live with this or

EDwsd304:438	S12:	 from diversity to unity in a negative sense 
EDwsd304:439	S3:	 yeah so unity versus diversity
EDwsd304:440	S12:	 i would say first you have diversity before you have made the decision and then it gets to unity 
EDwsd304:441	S3:	 or 
EDwsd304:442	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:443	S12:	 but in all kinds of sense not only 
EDwsd304:444	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:445	S12:	 unity 
EDwsd304:446	S3:	 so it's a trend from

EDwsd304:448	S3:	 diversity to unity 
EDwsd304:449	S3:	 and and do you also want to say something about these economic forces
EDwsd304:450	S12:	 erm no wha- what was in there was just the the source of a- all the all the xxx or er the reinforcement of of the movement was the decision to take one language as lingua franca having x the consequences on every domain which is economic politic hh whatever xxx xxxx xx every

EDwsd304:464	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:465	S8:	 like i stated that one er country it was czech republic just have lost their national identity because of the globalization process they adopted er english really deeply to their er culture and they become kind of

EDwsd304:478	SX-m:	 hm 
EDwsd304:479	S1:	 hh then he wrote also another part from somebody going to spain and there s- the s- the span- the spanish people took another turn with english as lingua franca hh they used it everybody spoke english fluently hh but at the same time they kept their own culture their own habits and of course there was some americanization but it was spanish mainly although they spoke english fluently

EDwsd304:660	S15:	 which which it comes from well the scenario was that erm when i was writing my essay er it was when the proposal for a new budget for two thousand and five in norway er was on the news hh so and they cut the budget for higher education so i thought okay they want to reduce the the administration expenses so what did they do
EDwsd304:661	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:662	S15:	 well they sent all the students to other u- universities and they only preserve students who want to study norwegian language or topics related to norwegian culture er but to do that erm they send to universities in europe let's say but the thing is that if those students are going to pay scholarship i mean to er the university univer- universities have to er give lec- er lectures in english because then it will be easier for the norwegian government to s- to compare okay this is a good er university or not if it's in a language xx or a language they don't er the students don't speak or the curric- curriculum is in another language th- they er the norwegian authorities want to understand so actually what the norwegian government is doing is to reduce the co- the cost of the higher education by sending students away er abroad 
EDwsd304:663	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:664	S15:	 erm and erm er the use of english it's more important 
EDwsd304:665	S1:	 okay

EDwsd304:671	S1:	 mhm yeah maybe then a me- a metatrend in your story is maybe also cost reduction versus quality or versus i don't know something else you might decide upon that but 
EDwsd304:672	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd304:673	S1:	 one trend is more cost reduction

EDwsd304:692	SX-3:	 mhm

EDwsd304:709	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:710	S14:	 you have erm the quality is worse and then er 
EDwsd304:711	S1:	 mhm

EDwsd304:713	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:714	S14:	 this is er a comfortable more comfortable and then it's one direction and er diversity costs too much money

EDwsd304:738	S6:	 any other varieties 
EDwsd304:739	S1:	 and maybe also i don't see it now erm the creation or not the creation but in the future there will be some kind of new language not english but euro-english hh a thing that is also with the espenese like there will be something else as a lingua franca than english x 
EDwsd304:740	S11:	 yeah it it there is some overlap xx 
EDwsd304:741	S1:	 okay x new language so xxx i think it fits also there 
EDwsd304:742	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:743	S3:	 okay it's a good one i think thank you i saw two other people er [S16] and 
EDwsd304:744	S16:	 hm

EDwsd304:748	SX-f:	 @
EDwsd304:749	S16:	 er well i wanted er to say mine hh because it it is about this efficiency and eco- er that the diversity it too costly hh er i was writing about er european parliament efficiency 
EDwsd304:750	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:751	S16:	 er that means that now er european parliament works pretty inefficiently er and one of the reasons may be hh that they have to translate everything in all the languages 
EDwsd304:752	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:753	S16:	 and er my future essay was in two thousand fourteen hh and the trend was that er the m ps and er the people er there the politicians hh er they were tired of waiting for the document to come in my language in slovak in these little languages 
EDwsd304:754	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:755	S16:	 er so they just took it in english and studied in english er in ten years there there were there would be younger people who speak good english because there is such a trend that everybody learns english because it is useful and efficient 
EDwsd304:756	S1:	 okay 
EDwsd304:757	S16:	 so the trend is simply adoption of english just because it is efficient and it helps you 
EDwsd304:758	S1:	 okay

EDwsd304:760	SX-f:	 mhm @
EDwsd304:761	S1:	 so maybe efficiency could be a t- trend which is applied to language but maybe also in other fields

EDwsd304:1043	S3:	 er yeah xx hh 
EDwsd304:1044	S1:	 okay well the the main goal with the axes hh is that we have to find two trends like two opposite trends erm but they cannot be interrelated because otherwise it's getting too close hh so try to pick one trend which you think is really really really big so it really encompasses a lot not only at the language level but a really big trend which is also in in the whole of society 
EDwsd304:1045	S3:	 if if i may add something to that it s- should be an external trend something

EDwsd304:1871	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1872	SX-f:	 mhm

EDwsd304:1874	S6:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1875	S1:	 is that clear yes
EDwsd304:1876	S15:	 er but i understood it as english on the one side and the other side y- you have your mother tongue and french and other languages and not only 
EDwsd304:1877	S1:	 mhm yeah

EDwsd304:1884	S15:	 yah 
EDwsd304:1885	S1:	 thank you yes
EDwsd304:1886	SX-12:	 i xxx a solution it would be nice if you could put two if you could one is english-only and national regional language which is 
EDwsd304:1887	SX-f:	 hm 
EDwsd304:1888	SX-12:	 in my view quite static 
EDwsd304:1889	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1890	SX-12:	 and if you put investment in on a comparison we could have a dynamic one 
EDwsd304:1891	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1892	SX-12:	 seem what's xx to de- 
EDwsd304:1893	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1894	SX-12:	 developing the scenario 
EDwsd304:1895	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1896	SX-12:	 it could be quite interesting to compare them 
EDwsd304:1897	S1:	 but you can 
EDwsd304:1898	S1:	 mhm i understand your point 
EDwsd304:1899	SX-12:	 x 
EDwsd304:1900	S1:	 but you can put the investment part in- -to your scenario because if we take two axes we have eight scenarios 
EDwsd304:1901	SX-12:	 if if it's 
EDwsd304:1902	SX-12:	 okay you can put them together to one 
EDwsd304:1903	S1:	 no no no you you take one scenario later but you can of course think about hh how the government will finance it or 
EDwsd304:1904	SX-12:	 okay 
EDwsd304:1905	SX-12:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1906	S1:	 what's gonna happen in your scenario how did it happen 
EDwsd304:1907	S3:	 for instance er unity and english er english-only would lead to government investments to er enhance this xx xx x 
EDwsd304:1908	SX-12:	 right yeah 
EDwsd304:1909	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd304:1910	SX-12:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1911	S1:	 yeah and legislation for example 
EDwsd304:1912	SX-12:	 all right 
EDwsd304:1913	S1:	 so you can fill that in later so i think the investment part is maybe part of your scenario later on yes does that satisfy right 
EDwsd304:1914	SX-12:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1915	S9:	 i have a question 
EDwsd304:1916	S1:	 mhm 
EDwsd304:1917	S9:	 xxx back to the horizontal axis i'm just a bit confused because hh we decided on university and diversity but i thought it might be getting away from the title of this whole conference i've always wanted to branch out and conjure up new kind of meanings or something so i wondered why we're using it again 
EDwsd304:1918	S3:	 yes it's a spontaneous process @@ but yeah it's true er it's already in the title 
EDwsd304:1919	S1:	 because the group decided on it yeah 
EDwsd304:1920	S1:	 but the group decided on it before so i think it's not wise to step back on that now 
EDwsd304:1921	S9:	 oh i just wanted to 
EDwsd304:1922	S1:	 yeah 
EDwsd304:1923	S9:	 understand
