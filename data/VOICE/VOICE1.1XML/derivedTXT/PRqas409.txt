PRqas409:1	S1:	 er we have time for a short discussion now erm we will have to finish er punctually at one so erm we will have to sort of cut some time with the discussion erm hence i er ask you to to pose your questions again quite er shortly and concisely okay are there any questions
PRqas409:2	S2:	 maybe i i can ask 
PRqas409:3	S1:	 please mhm
PRqas409:4	S2:	 o- one question to mister [S3/last] er you asked whether the central europe is an optimal currency area i like to ask you a a a question xx to the er euro zone is a optimal currency area and er especially to speak about the @ er the deficit maastricht criteria which should be three per cent of the er gross domestic product my question is er ho- how does it look with the total debts of the of the countries especially i heard that there are big debts of of the countries in i- in in the pension reforms for example france should should have announced two hundred per cent of the a g er gross domestic product an internal debt er erm because of the of the pensions and these governments are not that fast to solve these problem so that this couldn't cause some problems in the future if all these countries would be connected by one one currency
PRqas409:5	S3:	 yah er thank you for the question well the first thing is whether the other countries are er inside er e m u r optimal currency area this could to some extend er answer this when you look er to er er some of the small countries er you er apart from greece er you see them in this er right hand si- upper right hand side er er right hand side er corner the big countries of course so by definition since they er compose a big part of e m u er they are er optimal currency area because it's the average e m u is er more or less er similar to er these countries er have a dramatic impact on what what average e m u country is so countries like portugal er spain er austria er seem to define er in terms of their response to er shocks it's similar to to er other countries er in terms of the er reforms er and you mentioned er specifically pension reform i- it's a bit er sad that er er when you f- for example when you do pension reform you have a deficit er for ten twenty years of transitory def- deficit that is counted as a deficit er yo- er and is er then increasing or is er making the fiscal space smaller for the countries that want to reform the pension er so if for example germany or france is very close to three per cent of g d p in terms of fiscal deficit levels they cannot afford to reform pensions unless they cut size of the other expenditures so this is politically very then difficult to do and in fact this maastricht criterion could er not provide good er motivations for the policy makers to do this er so the maastricht criteria in general f- forces countries not to spend too much but it doesn't er force them motivate them to implement specific reforms like a pension or tax reform and so on it just provides a very crude maximum er er maximum er er level of fiscal deficit to g d p but doesn't in this case is- ac- actually er er erm does the opposite thing is that since these expenditures are calculated as expenditures it demotivates those countries to implement those reforms
PRqas409:6	SX-6:	
PRqas409:7	S4:	 if i can say one thing er more er what i think from the experience from czech republic i think that the debate is really too much concentrated on the maastricht criteria itself and er the things like er well the the reform of the er er the reform of the pension systems and the very needed reform on the labor market er are little behind just and er er this er wha- what i think er well er concerning the fiscal policy it is very important to have as you said er enough space er for an fiscal policy and er er three per cent is just er one number and er er well i think maastricht cria- criteria too much simplify some things
PRqas409:8	S1:	 mhm please 
PRqas409:9	S5:	 yah one question how would you actually encourage the different countries to implement those reforms i mean h- what kind of laws would you introduce or what kind of other other med- er mechanism 
PRqas409:10	S3:	 hh well it's more sort of a a politically pol- political economic question
PRqas409:11	SX-m:	 hm 
PRqas409:12	S3:	 what er seems to be the most optimal way out of implement reforms is first you have to have to some extend a smart government as initial condition but then you should implement reforms as soon as possible and concentrate then in the first one or two years of the er election cycle and of which is the ruling for f- for your turn er because then you are hoping that the voters will see the first fruits of those reforms an- and will not vote you out after the fou- four years we have an example a- er in hu- hungary czech republic is that sometimes er the governments were not doing much in the fi- in the first two years and only later were pushed either by financial markets like in holland or in hungary er to implement reforms at a later stage of their economy cycle which means that basically n- next time they will be voted out and then there is this er general wisdom that er it doesn't pay to implement reforms because the voters will turn a blank eye on you but er maybe the sequence if on the of the reforms were not was not optimal that er even though it might be difficult er for er for people for households to ha- all these reforms concentrated in very short term er from political economic point of view probably makes sense i don't think you should in legislation you can er do much to
PRqas409:13	S4:	 it- it's not only the question of legislation but a question of timing the reforms in well not now we'll have this in czech republic is that we are probably going to wait for the pension reforms ne- next three or four years because it's the well last two years now for er the current government and they're not going to be brave enough to er er to implement a a reform we need so it's an old x 
PRqas409:14	S6:	 erm i would like to know did the crisis of the stability pact have an impact on the attitude of your countries towards erm the e m u
PRqas409:15	S4:	 mhm well er i guess not so much we have to meet er the maastricht criteria to get into the euro zone but er well probably in the public discussion er er the er er the limited number of three per cent of g d p doesn't er doesn't sound so strong er as it used to but er i would say well there're also there're er debates on the reform of the er stability and growth pact but er er still er well we have czech in czech republic er very big problems with public deficits and well nearly everyone er knows that this is a crucial problem and er the debates about the reform of the stability and growth pact are erm beside i bes- are beside that so it's it doesn't influence so much 
PRqas409:16	S3:	 for slovakia maybe in terms of the attitude or views of the more conservatives right wing parties it has a detrimental er impact on er on er their view of er on on on their support for the single currency because the situation when er er the biggest er economies er are not getting fined but smaller economies might be fined of course that doesn't er create a er er a good er environment er for sm- small countries like er er czech republic or slovakia so if anything it er has a negative impact of course if the er discussion would be more theoretically based and not based just on the fact that you know french german cannot make it er so er the maastricht c- criteria would be sort of a structural fiscal deficit and opposed to the xx fiscal deficit it could be more understandable maybe the current definition of the maastricht criteria is not the best one but if it is it's based just on the fact that some of the big countries cannot make it that of course doesn't create er er a good environment for er some of the support in er in our countries
PRqas409:17	SX-m:	 mhm 
PRqas409:18	S1:	 any further questions okay there're no questions i would like to thank you hh er for coming here erm for presenting your findings i would like to thank you for your for your cooperation for your questions for your interest erm i wish you a great lunch break now er i don't know if you're going into any of the er workshops in the afternoon i will be i will be er mostly in workshop eight so er for me it's going to be a short lunch break i hope it's more enjoyable for you and er i hope you have a good time at the rest of the conference and er see you around sometime bye-bye
