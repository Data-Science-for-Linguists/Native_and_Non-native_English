POmtg444:285	S5:	 a taste of german

POmtg444:287	S5:	 erm 
POmtg444:288	SX-4:	 but 
POmtg444:289	S5:	 or you know are you you have to decide ourselves if the booklet is about a particular country
POmtg444:290	SX-f:	 in theory 
POmtg444:291	S5:	 or if it's about a particular language
POmtg444:292	SX-f:	 yeah it is 
POmtg444:293	S5:	 if it's about a particular country 
POmtg444:294	SX-6:	 yes language

POmtg444:296	S5:	 that's okay 
POmtg444:297	S7:	 yes

POmtg444:300	SX-f:	 no but here 
POmtg444:301	SX-6:	 no but a language is 
POmtg444:302	S1:	 no not always be because that's the problem that [S2] has for x 
POmtg444:303	SX-f:	 picture xxx 
POmtg444:304	S4:	 for for example the last part of the book is about the country
POmtg444:305	SX-6:	 er the language is spoken in that country and 
POmtg444:306	S1:	 i know 
POmtg444:307	SX-2:	 yeah but perhaps we leave the exactly the 
POmtg444:308	S4:	 erm 
POmtg444:309	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg444:310	SX-2:	 er the flags we take the flags out and just write here somewhere english german whatever 
POmtg444:311	S1:	 yeah 
POmtg444:312	SX-2:	 dutch 
POmtg444:313	SX-6:	 yes yes

POmtg444:316	SX-f:	 xxx yeah 
POmtg444:317	SS:	 and 
POmtg444:318	SX-2:	 then it's a lot easier 
POmtg444:319	SX-6:	 they don't count because they a little there 
POmtg444:320	S1:	 well you couldn't i tried to to use the flags of the different participating countries but in some cases it doesn't really make sense because w- we have an austrian flag and a belgium flag and austrian is not the language 
POmtg444:321	SX-f:	 mhm 
POmtg444:322	S2:	 exactly e- exact- 
POmtg444:323	S1:	 whereas belgium is not a language as well 
POmtg444:324	SX-f:	 you're so @ this is 
POmtg444:325	S8:	 no but it should be already xx us it is the way you see all the xx 
POmtg444:326	S1:	 i know well you see i i i didn't want the flag of holland on that 
POmtg444:327	S8:	 no no no no of course 
POmtg444:328	S5:	 think that's the big 
POmtg444:329	S8:	 the new problem 
POmtg444:330	S5:	 it's not so much an issue 
POmtg444:331	S1:	 and you didn't want a flag of germany on it 
POmtg444:332	S5:	 really with spain 
POmtg444:333	S5:	 cos in europe there's only 
POmtg444:334	S2:	 of course 
POmtg444:335	S5:	 spain really that's equated with spanish but in other 
POmtg444:336	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg444:337	S5:	 in other parts of europe 
POmtg444:338	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg444:339	SX-f:	 okay 
POmtg444:340	S5:	 i think it is 
POmtg444:341	SX-10:	 yeah 
POmtg444:342	S1:	 and romanian as well 
POmtg444:343	S2:	 of course and also 
POmtg444:344	S1:	 and in a foreign language 
POmtg444:345	S2:	 you can 
POmtg444:346	S5:	 so 
POmtg444:347	S2:	 almost see no difference between the romanian

POmtg444:356	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg444:357	S1:	 it it looks

POmtg444:359	SX-f:	 yeah i boosted myself in the summer 
POmtg444:360	S1:	 yeah i know xx yeah 
POmtg444:361	S5:	 but i think they c- can cause problems so if you just put english 
POmtg444:362	SX-f:	 yeah 
POmtg444:363	S5:	 german say 
POmtg444:364	S1:	 yeah
