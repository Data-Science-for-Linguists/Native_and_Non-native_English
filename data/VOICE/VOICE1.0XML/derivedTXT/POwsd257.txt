POwsd257:373	S11:	 do i have to pick out some issues to have er it er do we have to pick out some issues it's a broad theme 
POwsd257:374	S1:	 yeah it's a broad issue i know erm but it's 
POwsd257:375	SX-7:	 yah 
POwsd257:376	S1:	 mainly focused in how to combat discrimination 
POwsd257:377	SX-6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:378	S1:	 through employment's policy taking into account 
POwsd257:379	S11:	 aha 
POwsd257:380	S1:	 er one very important thing which is age plus the other erm the other diversities that we have and in the other hand how to prevent and fight against visible and invisible causes and consequences of precarious work so in one side we have youth employment policies
POwsd257:381	S7:	 erm 
POwsd257:382	S1:	 and er discrimination 
POwsd257:383	S6:	 there's a question [S1] 
POwsd257:384	S7:	 no no- not a question it's suggestion erm maybe we could like erm start erm 
POwsd257:385	S1:	 okay
POwsd257:386	S7:	 collecting instruments of youth employment policies to to like be erm yah erm erm erm erm talking of about the s- s- same thing at the same time a little bit tha- that we like erm first of all talk about yah the different measures that we consider could be part of erm youth employment policies and then we see okay erm 
POwsd257:387	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd257:388	S7:	 is this like the solution er in order to fight discrimination in order to reach social inclusion or like erm where are it's again the yah what can we do and where are the limits thing that i mentioned this morning erm then that we then say maybe there are like 
POwsd257:389	SX-m:	 hm 
POwsd257:390	S7:	 also things that erm cannot be reached through e- employment policies maybe erm we also have to look at not in this seminar but later on in like at cultural er integration sports whatever or er the er social inclusion can also be reached through other things than just employment policy
POwsd257:391	S1:	 mhm yah this could be erm 
POwsd257:392	S2:	 maybe er we cannot do this way to have some similarities and differences betwe- er first of all similarities er and er er er differences between the countries
POwsd257:393	S1:	 yah 
POwsd257:394	S1:	 erm 
POwsd257:395	S1:	 here we had also er kind of because first my first thing was trying to have a little bit of brainstorming about our erm 
POwsd257:396	SX-m:	 hm 
POwsd257:397	S1:	 our feelings about the two plenaries having this information and afterwards with this information try to organize this information base in two different things
POwsd257:398	S7:	 okay 
POwsd257:399	S1:	 in the one side is er analyzing more or less this strength this strengthen of the policies and the measures taken in the countries in the other side analyzing what are the weaknesses of this policies what we don't like to them
POwsd257:400	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd257:401	S1:	 and in the other side identifying grou- good practices and er 
POwsd257:402	S2:	 solutions 
POwsd257:403	S1:	 yah 
POwsd257:404	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd257:405	S1:	 things that we like that 
POwsd257:406	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd257:407	S1:	 are happening or in our countries or in other countries and like this we will have we'll be able of having a mission from the national and local level to the european one 
POwsd257:408	S2:	 mhm 
POwsd257:409	S1:	 so
POwsd257:410	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwsd257:411	S1:	 do you feel comfortable with this story 
POwsd257:412	SX-2:	 mhm 
POwsd257:413	SX-m:	 yes 
POwsd257:414	S8:	 the only question is that if you sta- if we start with our national situation 
POwsd257:415	S1:	 [S8] 
POwsd257:416	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd257:417	S8:	 er i don't know wha- how much time we we have to to deal with this but i don't feel that we 
POwsd257:418	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd257:419	S7:	 mhm 
POwsd257:420	S8:	 we'll have a lot to to discuss what is the national situation and then 
POwsd257:421	S7:	 yah 
POwsd257:422	S8:	 move forward in international situation maybe it could be n- nice to say okay 
POwsd257:423	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd257:424	S8:	 we speak about the european level and after the national level otherwise we will be just like talking about what we know 
POwsd257:425	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd257:426	S1:	 okay 
POwsd257:427	S8:	 instead of talking what we should do together but that's my personal opinion 
POwsd257:428	S1:	 oh we can
POwsd257:429	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwsd257:430	S1:	 you gonna start in the way around instead of er explaining our national realities trying to analyze the european reality 
POwsd257:431	SX-m:	 mhm 
POwsd257:432	S1:	 try to identify what we can do together and afterwards try to see more or less what are the differences that we have in all countries yeah [S6]- 
POwsd257:433	S6:	 yeah just another suggestion that er perhaps also a one idea of this workshop i think is to er i like the role that you are doing er within your organizations
POwsd257:434	SX-7:	 mhm 
POwsd257:435	S6:	 and also perhaps the main positions that you have towards the policies which exist in the countries and the same time your role and the one which you er you proceed with european level and what you expect from it and also y- your coordination the european youth forum and then also to er to er try to er to identify from this brainstorming and from this session of discussions the main policy demands 
POwsd257:436	SX-1:	 mhm 
POwsd257:437	S6:	 that we would like to er to put ins- inside this er 
POwsd257:438	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd257:439	S6:	 er this common declaration or you know like the main ideas that we can share all together 
POwsd257:440	S10:	 yeah 
POwsd257:441	S7:	 yah 
POwsd257:442	S9:	 but erm distribute a bit split this a little bit afterwards 
POwsd257:443	SX-f:	 mhm 
POwsd257:444	S9:	 cos i mean there are so many things in one thing er er 
POwsd257:445	S6:	 but 
POwsd257:446	S7:	 yah yah that's what i think it's 
POwsd257:447	S6:	 no no it- 
POwsd257:448	S9:	 cos otherwise i forget maybe some things i would actually want to say but 
POwsd257:449	S7:	 from 
POwsd257:450	SX-f:	 yeah 
POwsd257:451	S7:	 but my problem is like with the discussions this morning and right now it's erm 
POwsd257:452	SX-m:	 yeah 
POwsd257:453	S2:	 there is one more situation 
POwsd257:454	S7:	 to me er i- i- nee- er i- 
POwsd257:455	SX-m:	 hm 
POwsd257:456	S7:	 maybe a little bit more structure i don't know 
POwsd257:457	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd257:458	S7:	 it's erm er yah we can talk about everything and it's it's nice to talk about everything but er that i'm looking for the red line through the seminar for like the the aims and so on i don't want to be destructive now yeah 
POwsd257:459	S6:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwsd257:460	S7:	 erm 
POwsd257:461	S9:	 no 
POwsd257:462	S7:	 that's not what i want but erm 
POwsd257:463	SX-m:	 hm 
POwsd257:464	S7:	 i- it it's just for me er hard to to follow
POwsd257:465	S2:	 yah 
POwsd257:466	SX-m:	 xx 
POwsd257:467	S9:	 hh er 
POwsd257:468	SX-f:	
POwsd257:469	S6:	 but the idea is to to find the role of youth organizations i think 
POwsd257:470	S7:	 yah 
POwsd257:471	S6:	 and er and 
POwsd257:472	SX-12:	 hold on 
POwsd257:473	S6:	 yeah 
POwsd257:474	SX-12:	 no no sorry you 
POwsd257:475	S6:	 no no it's just a very quick just to 
POwsd257:476	SX-m:	 hm 
POwsd257:477	S6:	 to try together to er to to see different processes which are undergoing and different issues 
POwsd257:478	SX-2:	 mhm 
POwsd257:479	S6:	 on which we can have positions in er different contexts and then to to try to promote the role of youth organizations in er in the development of policies but also as an actor er as a in the youth works as well doing in every day 
POwsd257:480	S1:	 for instance erm now we have in in all countries the european youth pact if we read the european youth pact 
POwsd257:481	SX-7:	 yah 
POwsd257:482	S1:	 youth organizations we should be involved in the reforms of the national action plans we should be involved in all the changes and measures taken in the different levels from the local to the national but is this really happening are youth organizations are we allow to be involved in the process
POwsd257:483	S7:	 yah 
POwsd257:484	S1:	 yah 
POwsd257:485	S7:	 and like for me then bef- it would be easier before we talk about the role of youth organizations within the youth pact 
POwsd257:486	SX-9:	 just 
POwsd257:487	S7:	 it would be easier for me like to erm talk about the youth pact first like what e- e- erm er er like what are advantages and disadvantages of the youth pact that's like the first step 
POwsd257:488	S9:	 hm 
POwsd257:489	S7:	 and then erm when you've talked about like general disadvantages and advantages then er you can say okay and within this er thing youth organizations have these chances and have these problems 
POwsd257:490	S1:	 yah but this is an example i have put now we have to focus on youth employment policies precarious work and discrimination
POwsd257:491	SX-9:	 the youth pact xx tomorrow 
POwsd257:492	S1:	 in the two plenaries that we have analyzed this morning
POwsd257:493	SX-9:	 x x

POwsd257:495	SX-9:	 yah

POwsd257:500	S1:	 will be the day for the european youth pact and 
POwsd257:501	SX-12:	 yeah 
POwsd257:502	S1:	 identify another group practices 
POwsd257:503	S7:	 okay i just er er take my answer as an example to then 
POwsd257:504	S1:	 okay 
POwsd257:505	S6:	 @@@
POwsd257:506	S7:	 @@@@
POwsd257:507	S12:	 so what about if er people er maybe just say a little bit about the experience they're having in er within their organization and the things that 
POwsd257:508	S7:	 yeah 
POwsd257:509	S12:	 that they want to be put into the policy so i i don't remember when we're all representing 
POwsd257:510	SX-6:	 yah 
POwsd257:511	S7:	 yah 
POwsd257:512	S12:	 t- to just say well this is how it is and this is how i don't know if you xx do this but just to say 
POwsd257:513	S7:	 mhm 
POwsd257:514	S12:	 okay these are the policies this is what's working this is what isn't and this is what we'd like 
POwsd257:515	SX-6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:516	S7:	 mhm okay 
POwsd257:517	S6:	 exactly 
POwsd257:518	S7:	 that's x yeah 
POwsd257:519	S1:	 okay this is what's 
POwsd257:520	S6:	 so that's 
POwsd257:521	S1:	 i will erm write it down what's working what's 
POwsd257:522	S12:	 not working 
POwsd257:523	S6:	 start with the xxx 
POwsd257:524	S12:	 and this is what we want 
POwsd257:525	S1:	 okay more clear thanks 
POwsd257:526	S9:	 oh 
POwsd257:527	S1:	 yah 
POwsd257:528	S9:	 er what er from the erm okay so erm er youth unemployment is er getting er quite some er attention er in the netherlands 
POwsd257:529	SX-f:	 can you xx 
POwsd257:530	S9:	 erm er we have an er like a sort of erm thing that's called er operation jung er same pronunciation in dutch and er that's more like for erm from child to er to young 
POwsd257:531	S10:	 hm 
POwsd257:532	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd257:533	S9:	 so that involves all ages and this deals with er child poverty and things like that but er we also have a special er 
POwsd257:534	S1:	 hm 
POwsd257:535	S9:	 task for the youth unemployment which er tries to get er jobs for people and er give people that are you know have troubles on their school because of their behavior a second chance er you know the the people who really have trouble er things like that erm erm but erm what's not working is er the fact that erm well there's a a mismatch between erm different certain sectors they have a lot of er internships er and erm people don't come like a construction or something and then at er other sectors er yeah people cannot er get an internship and these are mostly the erm how do you call it in english well it's at least the more er practical er orientated er kind of jobs
POwsd257:536	SX-6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:537	S9:	 so not er higher education er that's no problem but it's more xx the kind of lower jobs and er erm so it is also a problem is that er er if w- you say what do we want erm that erm you know this is a differen- difficult group it's not like erm well now you see that erm it's getting better with the economy so lots of people jung the youth unemployment is going down but erm this group is f- f- a lot harder to er to get the jobs for because they are yeah it's not just that they are unemployed so to speak you know 
POwsd257:538	S6:	 hm 
POwsd257:539	S9:	 but it's in a nutshell i don't know 
POwsd257:540	S1:	 then to sum up
POwsd257:541	S9:	 hh yah is being a development 
POwsd257:542	S1:	 what's would you identify wh- what's working 
POwsd257:543	S9:	 sorry oh yah er so what's working is er we have to st- so this this task for youth unemployment erm at one way it's working cos it's great that er it hasn't like a target you know to create jobs 
POwsd257:544	S6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:545	S9:	 and er i don't know ten thousands of jobs forty thousand jobs by the end of i don't know what and i guess that's working erm but erm our youth council is having some troubles with them because er they think er they are too harsh they have like a one-sided approach and erm so it's more like hey why do you don't you work you know er it's kind of this kind of er directives kind of er xx kind of die and erm so they hav- don't have a good relationship because no because er we're a bit er some of us are a bit er well they don't like this attitude towards youth 
POwsd257:546	SX-f:	 hm 
POwsd257:547	S9:	 er 
POwsd257:548	S1:	 so
POwsd257:549	S9:	 yeah i don't know how to say it you know like not like participating with us but more like doing yah saying that you have to go to work and this is what you have to do 
POwsd257:550	S6:	 aha

POwsd257:761	S7:	 hm 
POwsd257:762	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd257:763	S8:	 so if we are not decision makers we can give some ideas but that's all first situation the second one is that the approach that the governments are made is based on an economy and er economical model who actually doesn't exists i mean er our fathers start to work at thirteen fourteen fifteen twenty and now they say to us you need to to study and to study a lot until you have twenty-four twenty-five and then and maybe then you get a job but what happen is that who we realize that people who actually didn't go to school or didn't didn't stay in school they get some jobs 
POwsd257:764	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd257:765	S8:	 and when we finished our schools the jobs are already taken which means that yo- you s- need again to have more education t- in order to have more jobs but the problem is that we are talking about quality jobs and after you studied you want a quality job 
POwsd257:766	S1:	 mhm 
POwsd257:767	S6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:768	S8:	 and what we see is that you with you cou- have a lot of jobs but not the job that you study for

POwsd257:771	S1:	 yeah 
POwsd257:772	S6:	 mhm 
POwsd257:773	S8:	 so er by the figures i think that europe should create about thir- er three million jobs into the next ten years in order to keep er steady as er as a economical model and they also need to have ten millions more of the population almost in each country which means that in theory er we need to have a lot of kids or we need to have a lot of immigrants and europe is not opening its frontiers and at the same times our generation cannot be able to have kids because we start to work v- very late and we don't have enough money to to raise a family and to to stand a a family with two three or more kids so at this point what can i say er if we could say that
