POwgd449:20	S1:	 well 
POwgd449:21	S2:	 the 
POwgd449:22	S1:	 determine the aim of your of your activity and well 
POwgd449:23	SX:	 yeah 
POwgd449:24	S1:	 erm identify what you identify what you 
POwgd449:25	S5:	 otherwise you give me 
POwgd449:26	S1:	 want to achieve 
POwgd449:27	S5:	 okay should be the first one 
POwgd449:28	S2:	 but why this is here 
POwgd449:29	S4:	 we should write this there 
POwgd449:30	S5:	 er just listed 
POwgd449:31	S2:	 so you beat the learning for motivated and put down the aim 
POwgd449:32	S5:	 that one should be the first one but it is 
POwgd449:33	S1:	 i i know but we can we can rearrange them on the post-it 
POwgd449:34	S5:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd449:35	S2:	 rearrange them yes 
POwgd449:36	S1:	 erm erm erm so
POwgd449:37	S5:	 identify 
POwgd449:38	S2:	 it's no define 
POwgd449:39	S1:	 identity 
POwgd449:40	S2:	 the one food three nights 
POwgd449:41	S1:	 it's not identi- it this side 
POwgd449:42	S5:	 define 
POwgd449:43	S1:	 this side won't this side won't define your 
POwgd449:44	S5:	 define 
POwgd449:45	S1:	 aim 
POwgd449:46	S5:	 your aim 
POwgd449:47	S1:	 the aim of the activity and well 
POwgd449:48	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd449:49	S1:	 take it into account when you are preparing 
POwgd449:50	S5:	 it is it is already identity you can understand 
POwgd449:51	S2:	 so we have the aim the people involved the place where and why 
POwgd449:52	S5:	 no i think step by step with all activities everything is done there you know you know you don't have to put that right 
POwgd449:53	S2:	 how 
POwgd449:54	S2:	 yeah but it's very general but it's very general 
POwgd449:55	S5:	 the rank and the place you know the xxx xx 
POwgd449:56	S5:	 well it has to be general because if this has to be for 
POwgd449:57	S2:	 yeah yeah yeah but 
POwgd449:58	S5:	 different and 
POwgd449:59	S2:	 yeah but you have to have 
POwgd449:60	S5:	 isn't it 
POwgd449:61	S2:	 five six seven eight 
POwgd449:62	S1:	 no we only have five 
POwgd449:63	S2:	 yeah yeah i know 
POwgd449:64	S5:	 yah two that this will be important for you 
POwgd449:65	S2:	 but one two three are almost the same in fact
POwgd449:66	S1:	 you think so
POwgd449:67	S2:	 so well-informed team so why 
POwgd449:68	S1:	 that's totally different isn't it 
POwgd449:69	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd449:70	S2:	 well-informed means 
POwgd449:71	S6:	 are you getting on
POwgd449:72	S2:	 about what 
POwgd449:73	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:74	S2:	 what we are doing the aim is there 
POwgd449:75	S1:	 yeah yeah but that's about your team 
POwgd449:76	S2:	 in a way inform people about what we are doing 
POwgd449:77	S1:	 yes 
POwgd449:78	S2:	 so i tell you 
POwgd449:79	S1:	 that's a di- that's a different thing than than than defining your aim
POwgd449:80	S5:	 very very x x x i don't know but it's in so many 
POwgd449:81	S1:	 that's that's a bit in within your 
POwgd449:82	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd449:83	S1:	 your step-by-step plan that you need to 
POwgd449:84	S5:	 of course so i think 
POwgd449:85	S1:	 identify who needs to do what and
POwgd449:86	S2:	 i like this sharing what's difficult 
POwgd449:87	S5:	 yeah but i think yeah it's a little bit you really feel that they have to put everything 
POwgd449:88	S1:	 no 
POwgd449:89	S5:	 you know 
POwgd449:90	S1:	 no 
POwgd449:91	S5:	 otherwise you choose the language that just xx advantage is the you know 
POwgd449:92	S1:	 close but 
POwgd449:93	S5:	 it's repeating all the time 
POwgd449:94	S2:	 oh 
POwgd449:95	S6:	 xxx wanted to tell you 
POwgd449:96	S4:	 yeah yeah yeah i x need to tell her to do that

POwgd449:103	S6:	 xxx 
POwgd449:104	S4:	 yeah i think they are completely i don't know why
POwgd449:105	S6:	 is this your administrative staff
POwgd449:106	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:107	S6:	 it can happen that you get people who are just very unhelpful 
POwgd449:108	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:109	S6:	 no it's not easy i have to say 
POwgd449:110	S4:	 and we have all those carts with food the food was in the xx and i don't want the carts disappeared because i wanted i would have wanted both like [first name1] can do them i mean kind but the carts are very nice and found and delicious 
POwgd449:111	S6:	 why they can say all this is that you have all these things that roll about and let you know 
POwgd449:112	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:113	S6:	 xxx people manage 
POwgd449:114	S4:	 yeah and you were in before yeah but the moment we both changed in the bathroom there and we were like this and not talking to each other but we were so determined it was like you know xx x xx now they go for it you know it was so crazy and we kept laughing and doing stuff they hear no it was so crazy @
POwgd449:115	S6:	 so xx amazes me about all of these projects is you think no one is going to come to this 
POwgd449:116	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd449:117	S6:	 and especially xx no one's going to come to this so you think you know and then you think oh we don't want to come to this 
POwgd449:118	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:119	S6:	 we do don't go away 
POwgd449:120	S4:	 yeah yeah 
POwgd449:121	S6:	 i mean think about all these people you say you have a lot of people there and and i tell you lot of people stay till the end 
POwgd449:122	S4:	 yeah yeah they don't wanna go you know and he was quite about this because then we had to put everything back together and we saw it took us a lot of time and we had all those staff 
POwgd449:123	S6:	 but this is what the journal it's it's very important you say 
POwgd449:124	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd449:125	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd449:126	S6:	 it was in too 
POwgd449:127	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd449:128	S6:	 too identical 
POwgd449:129	S4:	 and also on the home page on our home page it's advertised like exactly five to eight 
POwgd449:130	S6:	 yeah 
POwgd449:131	S4:	 and that's it 
POwgd449:132	S6:	 they did the same with 
POwgd449:133	S4:	 yeah 
POwgd449:134	S6:	 inventing the xx cos when you have an open event like that you need to make sure all the people 
POwgd449:135	S4:	 they will go some time yeah 
POwgd449:136	S6:	 one thing as well but thinking about are you thinking about the food as well i forgot to mention that i mean in the organization 
POwgd449:137	S1:	 i know 
POwgd449:138	S6:	 just thinking about the role of the food because how much 
POwgd449:139	S1:	 yeah yeah yeah 
POwgd449:140	S6:	 that contributed i forgot you know if you if you put food at the center of it 
POwgd449:141	S1:	 well it's well determine where what what's what's the role of food going to be or 
POwgd449:142	S6:	 yeah yeah so that was more or less i was thinking about 
POwgd449:143	S5:	 so define the activity to define the role of 
POwgd449:144	S1:	 or or define yeah

POwgd449:286	S5:	 and they will go there cos we have to use both of them right xxxxx 
POwgd449:287	S1:	 yeah because yeah 
POwgd449:288	S5:	 and probably in some places it would be easier to 
POwgd449:289	S1:	 so you could you could say that you could send some kind of board to a gastronomy website for example but also to a languages website 
POwgd449:290	S5:	 yeah 
POwgd449:291	S1:	 and try to in- to include it in this section

POwgd449:302	S1:	 well 
POwgd449:303	S5:	 in time 
POwgd449:304	S1:	 you could you could just er some of the xx x x and then 
POwgd449:305	S5:	 but it's it's nice to be to be 
POwgd449:306	S1:	 after the 
POwgd449:307	S1:	 i know 
POwgd449:308	S5:	 xx x presentation could simply be 
POwgd449:309	S1:	 yeah 
POwgd449:310	S5:	 you know and erm and then send just looking internet it's time you see something xxxx 
POwgd449:311	S1:	 yeah
