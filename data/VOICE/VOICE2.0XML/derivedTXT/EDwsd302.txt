EDwsd302:207	S18:	 yah 
EDwsd302:208	S20:	 i think er about er people openness about er 
EDwsd302:209	S18:	 okay

EDwsd302:211	S18:	 tolerance and

EDwsd302:213	S18:	 if what 
EDwsd302:214	S20:	 if we erm write er for example er openness
EDwsd302:215	S18:	 yeah

EDwsd302:219	S18:	 okay
EDwsd302:220	S20:	 okay
EDwsd302:221	S18:	 i would say we write down five values and then we rank them 
EDwsd302:222	S20:	 okay yes 
EDwsd302:223	S18:	 so we agree that we could take openness in a sense of people being open to others xxxx 
EDwsd302:224	S20:	 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 
EDwsd302:225	S18:	 friendly and tolerant and accepting others 
EDwsd302:226	S20:	 exactly
EDwsd302:227	S18:	 all right then we take openness or should we call it is it is the word tolerance better or is o- 
EDwsd302:228	S20:	 oh yes 
EDwsd302:229	S20:	 yeah 
EDwsd302:230	S18:	 yeah all right because tolerance somehow includes being open
EDwsd302:231	S20:	 yeah
EDwsd302:232	S18:	 all right then we have tolerant
EDwsd302:233	S20:	 erm 
EDwsd302:234	S18:	 i think freedom that's something we have both have
EDwsd302:235	S20:	 yes 
EDwsd302:236	S18:	 probably we could we take that
EDwsd302:237	S20:	 i've freedom
EDwsd302:238	S18:	 i think of freedom of choice of opportunity 
EDwsd302:239	S20:	 yah 
EDwsd302:240	S18:	 xxxx 
EDwsd302:241	S20:	 yeah of course we can write 
EDwsd302:242	S18:	 yeah all right 
EDwsd302:243	S20:	 erm maybe on knowledge
EDwsd302:244	S18:	 knowledge
EDwsd302:245	S20:	 yeah
EDwsd302:246	S18:	 probably we can agree that er er er we can 
EDwsd302:247	S15:	 is going okay
EDwsd302:248	S18:	 yeah
EDwsd302:249	S20:	 yeah
EDwsd302:250	S15:	 everything's okay
EDwsd302:251	S18:	 we just have er very different values so we just 
EDwsd302:252	S15:	 but you can also try if for example you have two values which you both don't agree upon but you have something which is a little bit in between or something that encompasses the both 
EDwsd302:253	S18:	 xxx that 
EDwsd302:254	S18:	 yeah
EDwsd302:255	S15:	 two of them you can also take together a new value if you like if that makes it easier
EDwsd302:256	S18:	 right 
EDwsd302:257	S15:	 but you have to negotiate it 
EDwsd302:258	S18:	 yeah 
EDwsd302:259	S18:	 all right
EDwsd302:260	S15:	 and so you have to agree upon and of course you can also say like okay i really have to have this one in 
EDwsd302:261	S18:	 yeah
EDwsd302:262	S15:	 and then okay you can also pick one you know so you 
EDwsd302:263	S18:	 all right
EDwsd302:264	S20:	 okay
EDwsd302:265	S18:	 all right okay
EDwsd302:266	S15:	 adjust to each other 
EDwsd302:267	S20:	 er 
EDwsd302:268	S18:	 okay for exa- can i just say something i think that if you write down friends friendship
EDwsd302:269	S20:	 yes
EDwsd302:270	S18:	 i can go well that i think that's a great value but i think that somehow love is a kind of friendship 
EDwsd302:271	S20:	 yeah i know we can er tolerance we can er write under x write it's er some erm er what is er mean er 
EDwsd302:272	S18:	 yeah and write 
EDwsd302:273	S20:	 or is er so- yeah in some a s- er 
EDwsd302:274	S18:	 is included 
EDwsd302:275	S20:	 yeah yeah of course included
EDwsd302:276	S18:	 both friendship and love do you think both are included in tolerance
EDwsd302:277	S20:	 friends and lo- yeah i think that we 
EDwsd302:278	S18:	 in tolerance really i think that's something different then again
EDwsd302:279	S15:	 can i have one moment
EDwsd302:280	S20:	 so erm

EDwsd302:286	S17:	 oh 
EDwsd302:287	S15:	 which is also finished and start over again
EDwsd302:288	SS:	 ooph 
EDwsd302:289	S15:	 so you have one list with four people and so on and so on every time you finish as a group try to get together and make a new group
EDwsd302:290	S20:	 so f- f- for the first place tolerance for us
EDwsd302:291	SS:	 yeah
EDwsd302:292	S20:	 second freedom
EDwsd302:293	S18:	 yeah for example security and money i think that adds up you mean i think instead of if you have money you are more secure 
EDwsd302:294	S20:	 if you haven't money you can er you have a security and country town and it's er 
EDwsd302:295	S18:	 you have a secure life don't have to worry about things i think we can somehow add that up under the 
EDwsd302:296	S20:	 yeah yeah 
EDwsd302:297	S20:	 okay okay of course 
EDwsd302:298	S18:	 term of security 
EDwsd302:299	S18:	 is that all right for you
EDwsd302:300	S20:	 yeah you 
EDwsd302:301	S18:	 all right er to come back to the friendship i think that friendship is a nice idea i like that cos i think especially nowadays that's really an important value i think if somebody's able to have friendships to be open for others to be close to each other 
EDwsd302:302	S20:	 oh so we can er include to to open xxx no
EDwsd302:303	S18:	 but i i don't know i think friendship is another thing again it's like the ability to let somebody be close to you to be close to somebody else to share feelings to share thoughts to xxxx thoughts 
EDwsd302:304	S20:	 okay 
EDwsd302:305	S20:	 okay is 
EDwsd302:306	S18:	 i like that a lot
EDwsd302:307	S20:	 okay
EDwsd302:308	S18:	 so we write down friendship or something like 
EDwsd302:309	S20:	 yeah 
EDwsd302:310	S20:	 er maybe er relations 
EDwsd302:311	S18:	 do you mean 
EDwsd302:312	S18:	 relations human relations
EDwsd302:313	S20:	 yeah
EDwsd302:314	S18:	 xx sense of this yeah all right we we know what we mean with that
EDwsd302:315	S20:	 xx live er 
EDwsd302:316	S18:	 or human interpersonal relationships
EDwsd302:317	S20:	 yeah yeah yeah of course 
EDwsd302:318	S18:	 all right
EDwsd302:319	S20:	 personal relations human relations so it's er it's very important to you 
EDwsd302:320	S18:	 yeah yah i agree with you all right so we have four now 
EDwsd302:321	S20:	 we have four and we must er shall i say 
EDwsd302:322	S18:	 for me that's xxx 
EDwsd302:323	S20:	 maybe er knowledge
EDwsd302:324	S18:	 but is that a value
EDwsd302:325	S20:	 er i think that's the democracy is a very important and great xx knowing about er democracy about the same systems er holocaust systems er cultural so 
EDwsd302:326	S18:	 or a passion 
EDwsd302:327	S18:	 yes 
EDwsd302:328	S18:	 and education of course 
EDwsd302:329	S20:	 yeah of course 
EDwsd302:330	S18:	 shall we write xxx 
EDwsd302:331	S20:	 yeah
EDwsd302:332	S18:	 okay and is or what is our order how do we rank them
EDwsd302:333	S20:	 we decide er xxxx first place and maybe we change er some er numbers if you want of course 
EDwsd302:334	S18:	 yeah i don't know what is second to your mind 
EDwsd302:335	S20:	 i think put er freedom and tolerance it's erm it's a very important and er yeah of course 
EDwsd302:336	S18:	 okay 
EDwsd302:337	S18:	 all right security i think is very important as well or what is human relations 
EDwsd302:338	S20:	 yeah but if if we have er freedom and security it's
EDwsd302:339	S18:	 doesn't fit you mean
EDwsd302:340	S20:	 yeah it's erm 
EDwsd302:341	S18:	 i think it most fits because security is you want to be you want to have your freedom but you want to be secure 
EDwsd302:342	S20:	 yeah of course if we er have everything 
EDwsd302:343	S18:	 in your life 
EDwsd302:344	S18:	 but if you if you want we can take interpersonal relations

EDwsd302:1432	S17:	 and that's why we chose respect because we thought that respect is something more than just to tolerate
EDwsd302:1433	S13:	 yeah we had that argument as well 
EDwsd302:1434	S17:	 than just to accept 
EDwsd302:1435	S7:	 yah maybe should 
EDwsd302:1436	S17:	 so 
EDwsd302:1437	S7:	 you know i could i could i could

EDwsd302:1439	SX-6:	 yeah 
EDwsd302:1440	SX-6:	 yeah you're sure

EDwsd302:1443	S17:	 yeah or even not to care about its existence
